# Ideas

Things worth doing that are not yet decided, not yet tested, and not yet a phase. This file exists
because an idea that lives only in a conversation evaporates — the counterfactual mode below was
thought of, agreed to be good, and then not written down anywhere until it was asked for a second
time.

The three docs divide like this: [findings.md](findings.md) is what we measured and now know,
[plan.md](plan.md) is work that has been committed to, and this is everything else. An entry
graduates to plan.md when we decide to do it, or gets deleted with a line saying why not.

Each entry carries a **status**: `open` (nobody has looked), `blocked` (waiting on something
named), `promoted` (now in plan.md), or `dropped` (with the reason).

---

## 1. Counterfactual mode — disable an operation and re-run · open

The profiler already knows every registered operation. It could support suppressing one and
re-running the workload, reporting the two wall-clock numbers side by side.

**Why it matters more than it sounds.** In the Calcite trial an operation measured at **46% of the
time** turned out to be worth a **275× speedup** when removed, because it was inflating every other
operation's work as well as doing its own. A share and a counterfactual are different quantities
and the gap can be two orders of magnitude in either direction. The question a user actually has is
never "what fraction was this" — it is "what happens if I don't do it".

**The hard part, and why this may force the fork.** Suppressing an operation means not executing
it, and `op(id) { }` wraps a body that the host, not us, decided to run. A passive hook cannot help:
Calcite's `RelOptListener.ruleAttempted` is a notification with no return value and no veto. So this
needs one of three things — a host that supports skipping (rare), a fork of the host (see item 3),
or a profiler API where the *body* is ours to skip:

```kotlin
op(id) { ... }            // today: always runs
opUnless(id) { ... }      // could return null / skip when id is suppressed
```

The third is cheap in code we own and useless in code we do not, which is a real limit worth
stating rather than hiding.

**The objection that nearly kills it, and must not be designed around quietly.** Disabling logic
changes the workload. On the supply-chain traversal this idea comes from, switching a piece of
logic off *reduces the graph being traversed*, so the fast run is a smaller problem rather than the
same problem minus one part — the comparison measures two workloads, not two implementations. The
Calcite trial has the same flaw: removing the merge join rule changed the plan search space, so the
275× is a true wall-clock fact and is not "the cost of the rule". Recorded in [case.md](case.md),
because this is also the flaw in the manual method everyone falls back on.

So a "disable and re-run" feature that prints one number would be *industrialising a known-bad
method*. If it is built, it has to carry evidence about whether the workload stayed the same —
call counts of the other operations are the obvious check, and we already collect them: if
suppressing X halves how often Y fires, the comparison is void and the tool should say so rather
than print a speedup.

**Open sub-questions.** Does suppression mean "skip the body" or "run it and don't count it"?
How does it interact with nesting? Is the re-run automatic (two passes in one process, order
swapped — see the position artifact in findings.md) or is it a flag the user sets by hand?

## 2. Implement the same labels as JFR custom events, and compare · open

Build the Calcite labels a second time as `jdk.jfr.Event` subclasses with a rule field, correlate
the duration events against the execution samples offline by thread and timestamp, and compare the
resulting shares to ours and to JFR's inclusive view.

**Why.** Three reasons. It is a *third* independent validation of the sampler, on foreign code.
It prices the honest alternative, so [case.md](case.md)'s claim about custom-event cost stops being
an estimate. And it tells us whether the offline correlation produces anything our sample-time
lookup does not — per-instance durations, for one, which is exactly what the coarse tier wants.

**Cost.** Small. The label placement already exists; this reuses the same `RelOptListener` and
swaps what happens inside it.

## 3. Fork Calcite and label the generic internals · open

Clone Calcite, place spans by hand inside `VolcanoPlanner` and `RelSubset` — operand matching,
memo registration, set merging, digest construction — build, and re-run the trial.

**Why this is the more interesting experiment, not the fallback.** The trial labelled rule firings,
where Calcite has a clean domain boundary and a hook to hang it on. That is the easy case. The
unreached costs are the generic ones: `RelSubset.contains` at 24.6% of self time, `computeDigest` at
6.9%, the registration cascade that makes up most of the recursive tower. A flame graph is already
bad at those. Whether labels help *there* is untested, and it is the question that decides how
broadly the fine tier is useful.

**It is also the prerequisite for item 1** on this target, since suppressing a rule from outside is
not possible through a listener.

**Cost.** Not small — clone, patch, build a large Java project, and keep the patch alive. Wants an
explicit decision.

## 4. Read Datadog's Java profiler on context tagging · open

Datadog's profiler tags execution samples with the active trace/span context ("Code Hotspots") —
a thread-local label attached to samples, which is the same shape as this design. It is the closest
prior art we know of and nobody here has read it.

**Why.** To find out what they hit that we have not, before phase 4 fixes the API. Also to be able
to say honestly what is new here and what is not. [profiler.md](profiler.md) has the prior-art
section this belongs in.

**What we already have second-hand.** Phase 8 in [plan.md](plan.md) records that Datadog's attempt
at per-scope JFR events inflated recordings more than tenfold — which is where the "JFR as
transport, not as mechanism" position came from. That is a citation, not a reading.

## 5. The report should push "why is it expensive", not "delete it" · open

A profiler that prints a ranked list of shares invites exactly one response: remove the top row.
The Calcite trial produced a 275× speedup by deleting a planner rule — and the honest reading is
that the rule was structurally incapable of paying off *in that workload*, not that it is useless.
The output made the wrong action look obvious.

**What this might mean concretely.** The counterfactual warning (item 1 and friction item 5) is the
minimum. Beyond that: showing call counts beside shares already reframes "expensive" as "expensive
per call" or "called too often", which are questions rather than verdicts. Whether the report can
do more than that without editorialising is genuinely unclear.

## 6. Leave the profiler on permanently · dropped

Dropped as a goal: this is a developer's tool, run in profiling sessions and perf harnesses on a
machine you control, not an always-on agent inside a live system. Everything that followed from the
always-on framing goes with it — windowing for a process that has been up for a week, cross-process
aggregation, an attach agent, and the objection that the spinning sampler costs a core. A core is
an accepted cost here, the same way nobody closes Spotify to run a profiler.

**What survives, for a different reason.** The ~2 ns hook is not justified by a production resource
budget; it is justified by the **observer effect**. The target regime is operations of tens to
hundreds of nanoseconds, and an instrument costing 100 ns would be measuring itself. That
requirement is unchanged and is the reason the hook was worth the work.

**And a much smaller need survives too:** within a single session you want to reset and take more
than one snapshot — *"clear it, I am about to run the thing"*. That is a small feature, not the
windowing machinery, and item 7 needs it as well.

## 7. A perf-regression harness — the profiler as a CI gate · open

Run a labelled workload on every build, keep the per-operation shares and call counts, and fail or
flag when one moves. Still a developer's tool by any reading — it runs where the tests run, not in
a live system — so none of the always-on machinery applies.

**Why it fits this design particularly well.** Call counts are *deterministic* in a way timings are
not: if an operation fires 78,756 times on one build and 240,000 on the next, that is a real change
in behaviour and no amount of machine noise produces it. Shares need a noise floor and a tolerance;
counts need neither. A regression gate built on counts first and shares second would be unusually
robust for the genre, and no stack profiler can offer it because none of them have counts.

**What it needs that does not exist.** Machine-readable output — the report is `render()` to text.
Run-to-run comparison, with the tolerance discipline from findings.md rather than a fixed
percentage. And a session reset, so a harness can measure phases separately.

**What it does not need**, and this is the point: no agent, no windowing, no always-on story, no
cross-process aggregation.

## 8. Suspected defect: the label follows the thread, not the task · registry half fixed

*Reasoning from the source, not yet reproduced. A test is the first thing to write.* Two hazards
that look like one problem and are not — they hit different tiers, in opposite ways, and want
different fixes. Recorded here rather than in findings.md because nothing has been measured yet.

| | attribution | slot registry | tier affected |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Coroutines** | **broken** — the label follows the thread, the work follows the continuation | fine; a dispatcher pool is bounded | coarse only |
| **Virtual threads** | **correct** — the JDK gives each virtual thread its own `ThreadLocal`s, so the slot follows the vthread across carrier switches | **explodes** | **fine, today** |

The first version of this entry treated them as one thing and had the impact backwards.

### The fine tier is safe from coroutines, and the reason is structural

The defect needs a **suspension point between the label write and the restore**. Nothing else
triggers it. If the body does not suspend, the label is set and restored on the same thread in the
same continuation, and the attribution is correct with no assumption required.

And a suspending body **is by definition not a fine-grained operation**: a suspension point costs a
continuation allocation plus a dispatch, hundreds of nanoseconds at best, against the tens of
nanoseconds the fine tier exists for. So "fine-grained" and "suspends inside the op" are mutually
exclusive by construction. The fine tier's same-thread assumption is self-enforcing rather than
merely convenient, which is worth knowing before anyone spends effort defending it.

This is also what [plan.md](plan.md) already decided from the other end — phase 4 is same-thread and
*"crossing threads is phase 5, and the two are worth separating so that propagation bugs cannot be
confused with tier bugs."* The coroutine defect is squarely a phase 4/5 problem, not a fire in what
is shipped.

### But the API does not enforce the boundary, and cannot do it cheaply

`op(id) { somethingSuspending() }` compiles with no warning, because Kotlin inlines the lambda into
the calling function and it inherits the call site's suspend-ness. The clean compile-time fix is
marking the lambda `noinline` — the lambda becomes a real function object of non-suspend type, so
suspend calls inside it become illegal — but that costs an allocation per call, which is fatal for
exactly the tier being protected.

So the guard has to be **runtime and opt-in**: a checked mode that verifies at exit that the
calling thread still owns the slot captured at entry. That is a second `ThreadLocal` lookup, which
is the expensive half of the hook — acceptable in a debug run, not in the measured one. A real
constraint on any fix, and it should be settled before phase 4 rather than during it.

### What goes wrong, mechanically

**Coroutines.** `op(id) { }` is an inline function, and Kotlin permits suspension inside an inline
lambda, so `op(id) { somethingSuspending() }` inside a `suspend fun` compiles with no warning. What
then happens:

```kotlin
val slot = Profiler.slot()          // thread A's slot, captured here
slot.setOpaque(id)
try { return body() }               // suspends; resumes on thread B
finally { slot.setOpaque(prev) }    // clears A's slot, not B's
```

- Thread A's slot stays set to `id` for the whole suspension, while A goes on to run unrelated
  work — all of it billed to `id`.
- Thread B, where the work actually resumes, was never labelled, so the real time lands on
  whatever B's slot happened to hold.
- The restore writes to the wrong slot.

Wrong in both directions, silent, and the numbers look plausible. This matters more than an
ordinary bug because [profiler.md](profiler.md) lists *"coroutines break attribution — work is
spread across dispatcher threads and suspensions cut the trail"* as one of the three reasons the
existing tools fail here. It is a founding motivation, and the implementation currently has the
same defect it was built to fix.

**Virtual threads.** `Profiler.slot()` is a `ThreadLocal`, so every virtual thread gets its own
`OpSlot` appended to a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` — an O(n) array copy per thread created, quadratic
over a run — and the sampler then walks the whole list every millisecond. `release()` is manual, so
anything not released stays in the walk list forever. A target that creates virtual threads freely
does not degrade this gradually; it makes the sampler's tick unbounded. The class doc records the
assumption this was built on — *"threads are expected to register themselves up front, so the list
is stable by the time the sampler starts"* — which is the bench's threading model, not a real
target's.

Note that the virtual thread half needs **no suspension and no coroutine**. A target that runs
perfectly ordinary 20 ns operations on a million short-lived virtual threads kills the registry on
its own. That is why it is the half that touches shipped code.

**Both are properties of the *target*, not of how the profiler is deployed.** They bite a developer
profiling their own app on their own machine exactly as hard as anything else would.

**Possible directions, none chosen.** A label carried on the coroutine context rather than the
thread, with a `ThreadContextElement` restoring it on each resume; a `suspend`-aware `op`; refusing
to compile against a suspending body; or accepting the limit and documenting it loudly. The virtual
thread half wants a different slot registry — one that does not copy on every thread and can evict
without being asked.

## 9. Detect when a "fine" operation is not fine, for free · promoted

**Promoted to phase 3.5 in [plan.md](plan.md)**, reframed on the way: the point is not to detect bad
operations but to *bound the error* on every share at once, since "could this block?" classifies
everything as coarse and answers nothing. The detector below survives as one of three deliverables.

**The problem this answers.** The fine tier rests on two assumptions, and neither is verified:

1. **Operations do not block.** Argued from "a 20 ns operation has no time to block". But a fine
   operation can park on a **contended lock** — nanoseconds uncontended, microseconds or worse
   contended — and it can stall on a GC pause, a page fault, or a plain OS deschedule. When it does,
   occupancy inflates and the report says *"this operation is expensive"* where the truth is *"this
   operation is waiting for another thread"*. Opposite diagnoses, opposite fixes. For parallel
   in-memory graph traversal — the workload this tool exists for — that is not hypothetical.
2. **Threads ≤ cores.** The sampler reads slots, not cores, so with 200 runnable threads on 16
   cores every slot is counted every tick and occupancy over-reads CPU by 12×. The bench used 8 and
   16 threads on 16 cores and never oversubscribed, so this has never been exercised.

So the honest status is not that "fine operations do not block" is *wrong* — it is that it is a
**design intent asserted by the person placing the label, and never checked**. Which is exactly the
kind of thing this project keeps insisting on measuring instead of assuming.

**The detector, and it costs nothing on the hot path.** The sampler already reads the slot's
operation id. Have it read the **call counter for that id** in the same tick, and keep both:

| consecutive ticks | id | counter | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| same | same | **increased** | many short instances — genuinely fine |
| same | same | **unchanged** | *one* instance spanning ≥ 1 ms — 50,000× longer than a 20 ns operation should be |

That is the whole test. A single 20 ns instance has a 1-in-50,000 chance of being caught by one
sample, so an instance that survives two consecutive ticks is **not the size its label claims** —
which is a different statement from "not a fine operation", and the wording here used to be the
second. The [tier boundary](profiler.md#where-the-boundary-is) puts no upper limit on the fine tier,
and Calcite settled it in practice: labels of hundreds of microseconds, sampled, agreeing with JFR
to about a percentage point. What the detector finds is a label whose *description* is wrong, and
the useful consequence is that coarse is now **available** to it — not that fine has stopped working.
The counter increment already exists on the hot path; the sampler reads one extra word.
Entry and exit are untouched, which is the constraint that matters.

**What it cannot tell you alone.** An unchanged counter means "stuck in one instance", which
conflates blocked, descheduled, and legitimately-long-but-running. Separating those needs the
thread's state — but only for slots the counter test already flagged, which is normally almost
none. That wants a (weak) thread reference on the slot, off the hot path.

**What comes out.** Two counters per operation instead of one — samples where the instance was
fresh, and samples where it was stuck — which yields both an occupancy share and a running share
from the same pass. That is `span − CPU` for the fine tier, obtained without spans. And it is a
direct answer to the third requirement in [profiler.md](profiler.md): not just *where* the time
went, but *whether the operation was working or waiting*, which is the "why" a user needs before
they can act.

**On automatic promotion to the coarse tier.** Retroactive promotion is not possible — the coarse
tier allocates a context object at entry and those entries have already happened. Two weaker forms
are: *report it* ("operation X had N instances lasting ≥ 1 ms; consider a coarse label"), which is
cheap and probably enough; or *adaptive promotion*, where a detected operation starts allocating
contexts on subsequent entries, which needs a check at entry and therefore costs hot-path budget.
Start with reporting; the diagnostic is most of the value.

## 10. The duty cycle per thread, so the bound is not vacuous when threads idle · promoted, done

Phase 3.5 measures the duty cycle over every registered thread, and the shares it bounds are over
labelled samples only. A thread parked outside any operation therefore lowers the bound without
appearing in the thing being bounded. Starvation mode is the extreme case and it is now measured:
18.83% duty and a formally unbounded error on every share, while the three working threads were on
CPU 96% of the time and their shares were fine. Any real application with an idle pool thread hits
a milder version of this, and a report that cries wolf at a 30%-utilised thread pool will be
ignored when it is right.

The fix needs both halves per thread rather than in aggregate: thread *i*'s stall fraction from
`getThreadCpuTime`, which the duty walk already computes and throws away, and thread *i*'s labelled
fraction, which is the share of the window's ticks where its slot held an operation. The stall that
could possibly be inside labelled work is then `Σ min(stall_i, labelled_i)`, which in starvation
mode is the three working threads' 0.8% and not the twelve parked ones' 100%.

The labelled fraction per window needs a per-slot counter written by the sampler, which needs the
immutable slot index that the long-instance detector wants anyway — so the two are naturally done
together, and doing them together is probably right.

**Also parked here:** the duty walk currently runs on the sampling thread, where its dearest
observed walk is 214.7 µs once a second — enough to push one tick in a thousand out by a fifth of a
step, with no resync. A thread of its own that parks for a second would cost no core and no
punctuality; it would cost the guarantee that both cover exactly the same span. Not obviously worth
it, but worth remembering that the sampler's punctuality was expensive to get.

## 11. Correct the attribution bias using call counts · dropped

The sampler reads high on parents and low on short leaves. With call counts the correction is
arithmetic rather than a model, and the counts are already collected. Blocked on understanding the
bias well enough to know what to correct — see the open question in findings.md.

**Dropped, on the accuracy principle** in
[profiler.md](profiler.md#how-accurate-this-has-to-be-and-where-that-budget-goes). This bias is
roughly uniform in direction and largely cancels when shares are taken, so it cannot move a ranking
or point at the wrong operation — and those are the only two failures worth spending on. The worst
case we have measured is `tinyStep` at 15% of itself, on an operation holding 3.2% of the run.
Correcting it would change nobody's next action.

**What would revive it:** evidence that the bias scales with something that differs between
operations — call count, nesting depth — rather than with size alone. That is the shape that swapped
Lucene's top two clauses when a *timer* did it, and it would be intolerable here for the same reason.
The open question in findings.md is worth keeping for that reason and not for this one.

## 12. Make the floor check survive a machine whose clock moves · half promoted, half open

The floor check fires within a second on the argument that a below-floor label is a property of the
code, "identical on every machine and every rerun". Measured on Lucene, that is false here: this
laptop's throughput falls 2.2× between a two-second run and a forty-second one, and implied per-call
duration rises with it — 18.1 ns at two seconds, 54.1 ns at twenty, for the same label. `strict`
stopped a *correct* placement citing 27.5 ns against a settled 49.7 ns. Shares over the same range
moved by under 0.4 points, so only this one column is affected.

**The accuracy principle decides this, and it decides against the clever options.** By
[profiler.md](profiler.md#how-accurate-this-has-to-be-and-where-that-budget-goes), effort belongs
where an error can move a ranking or point at the wrong operation. A below-floor label does neither —
it is one row of a list, and the cost of getting it wrong is that we *stop a correct run*, which is
the loudest failure this tool can produce and the one we have actually observed. So the first move
is not a better estimator at all: **make it a warning rather than fatal, and keep the advice**, which
costs nothing and cannot stop anybody's correct placement.

**That half is done** — plan.md § 1a. The estimator options below are what is left, and they are now
optional: nothing downstream depends on the bound being tight, because nothing stops on it any more.

That leaves the estimator work optional rather than blocking, and it should be judged on whether it
buys anything a warning does not. Options 2 and 4 below remain interesting for their own reasons —
4 in particular, because "a floor in units of the hook" is a *ratio*, and a ratio is the only form of
this check that could ever be machine-independent the way the documentation claims.

Candidate fixes, cheapest first:

1. ~~**Require two consecutive windows.**~~ **Falsified by our own data — do not do this.** It was
   written on the assumption that the early estimate is *noisy*. It is not: the counters are
   cumulative and the estimate drifts steadily upward as the clock decays, so consecutive windows
   sit inside the drift and both fire. For `term#2` on the careful placement the bound reads 33 ns
   at one second, 41 ns at five, 53 ns at ten and 68 ns at twenty; any consecutive-window rule fires
   in the first half of that. Recorded rather than deleted because the reasoning was plausible and
   the data killed it, which is the only reason this file is worth keeping.
2. **Require a minimum evidence budget** — a sample count or an elapsed time — before the check may
   fire at all. This one *is* supported: at twenty seconds the check declines to fire on the careful
   placement and does fire on the naive one, so it is correct given time. But the crossover here is
   between five and ten seconds, and that number is a property of this laptop's throttle curve, not
   of anything the tool knows. Picking it is exactly the kind of judgement this project keeps
   getting wrong without a bench for it.
3. **Fire immediately only on an unambiguous margin, and wait otherwise.** The observed clock swing
   is 2.2–3×, so an estimate below floor/3 cannot be a throttling artifact and can be fatal on
   sight; between floor/3 and the floor, keep watching and downgrade to a warning if it never
   settles. Separates the two cases we have at twenty seconds and does not need a magic delay.
   Whether it separates them at one second is untested — at one second the naive and careful
   placements both read 24–28 ns for the same label, so possibly not.
4. **Normalise by an observed clock rate, or express the floor in units of the hook.** The three
   reasons for a floor — the hook is a visible fraction, the sampler reads short operations low, C2
   moves work across adjacent boundaries — are all *ratios*, and both sides of every one of them
   scale with the clock. An absolute-nanosecond floor is machine-dependent by construction. A floor
   of k × measured-hook-cost would be machine-independent, which is what the documentation already
   claims. It also implies the floor depends on *how the label was placed*: an inline `op(id){}` hook
   is 1.7 ns and a wrapped one is 3–6 ns, so a wrapped placement's floor should be two to three times
   higher — which would put most of the Lucene term clauses in marginal territory. Most principled,
   most work, and the conclusion may be unwelcome.

Related, and **settled**: the ladder's premise was that a below-floor label is *fatal* because it is
deterministic, while a long operation is only a *warning* because it depends on the day's workload.
The floor verdict turned out to depend on the machine's power state, so the distinction did not hold
and the rung was revisited rather than patched. Fatal now means one thing — a leaked label.

## 13. Report the boundary a label does not cover · partly promoted

Lucene's first placement wrapped the scorer and not the supplier that built it, and lost a third of
the decisive clause with nothing in the report to suggest it. The general problem is that the tool
cannot see what it was not asked to look at, and unattributed occupancy is reported only as one
aggregate number ("47.8% outside any operation").

**Half of this is now built and is not an idea any more.** The report carries absolute occupancy per
operation and coverage in thread-time, which solves the *iterative* case completely: move a label,
diff the occupancy column, see exactly what changed and by how much. Measured, in
[findings.md](findings.md#placement). What is left here is the cold start — a first run, nothing to
diff against, and no way to tell 36% coverage from 53% coverage.

Two routes remain, and they are complementary rather than alternative:

**Bracketing, which the coarse tier gives us for free.** You localise a gap by enclosing it. With a
coarse label around one search, the report can say *"48% unlabelled, all of it inside `search` and
none inside `collect`"*; two levels narrow it again. This is a better argument for phase 4 than the
one currently written into the plan, which is about per-execution durations and percentiles. It
needs no new mechanism at all — it falls out of the cross-tabulation the coarse tier already
implies.

**A low-rate stack sample, but only on the ticks that are unlabelled** — item 14.

## 14. A low-rate stack sample on unlabelled ticks · unblocked, ready to promote

We refuse to walk stacks because the cost is per sample. But localising a gap does not need a stack
per sample — it needs enough to tell "one place" from "everywhere". At 10 Hz over twenty seconds
that is 200 stacks against 20,000 label ticks, and it fires *only when the slot is empty*, which is
exactly when the thread is established not to be doing anything we are measuring. Nothing on the hot
path changes.

It would have caught the Lucene mistake outright. The missing work was 9.05% of all samples under
one distinctive frame, so ~18 of 200 low-rate samples would have landed there, and the report could
have said: *"of the time outside every label, the largest single place is
`RewritingWeight.scorerSupplier` — 31% of it"*. That names the missing label rather than announcing
that one exists.

**~~Unknown and blocking: what a stack costs.~~ Measured — see
[findings.md](findings.md#walking-a-stack). It is affordable by three orders of magnitude.**

- On the Lucene workload, at 10 and at 100 stacks/s the effect on search time is inside a ±2% floor;
  it only becomes measurable at ~76,000/s, where it is +9.10%. Extrapolated down: **0.001% at
  10 stacks/s.**
- Caller cost is ≈5 µs of handshake plus ≈0.11 µs per frame, and it *rises* as the rate falls —
  116.7 µs per stack at 10 Hz against 11.9 µs at 76 kHz, because an isolated handshake has to bring
  a running thread to a safepoint from scratch. Still 1.2 ms/s at the intended rate.
- **`Thread.getAllStackTraces` is a global safepoint (339.6 µs for 8 threads) and must never be used
  here.** Walk threads one at a time.

**The premise is now tested too, not only the cost.** Walking one stack per unlabelled window longer
than a tick — *on demand* rather than at a fixed rate — puts the missing label at **48.4%** of the
walked stacks on the broken Lucene placement and out of the top ten on the good one. The trigger
doubles as a filter: a long unlabelled window is a label somebody forgot, while pervasive
fine-grained unlabelled time is the host's coordination, and only the first fires it.

**Two things the test changed.**

- **Filter by thread state first, and it is free.** 76.6%–86.9% of triggered windows are a parked
  pool thread, not unlabelled work. `Thread.getState()` is a field read and needs no handshake, so
  the cheap check goes first; without it the answer is a screen of `Unsafe.park` and nothing else is
  visible.
- **The same filter belongs in the report, independently of this feature.** 79.2% of *all*
  unlabelled observations are a non-runnable thread, which is why the duty cycle reads 56% and why
  coverage reads 49.8% where against runnable occupancy it is ~83%. That is item 10's per-thread
  split and it is now the more valuable of the two.

**What is left to decide before this becomes a phase.** The measurement says it is affordable and the
test says it works; neither says what the feature should be.

1. *Where the rate comes from.* On demand, as tested — one stack per unlabelled window over a tick,
   which self-limits to the rate of the phenomenon — with a global cap, because self-limiting is not
   the same as bounded. A low uniform trickle alongside it would characterise the diffuse remainder
   that never triggers, which is the difference between "you forgot something" and "you are fine".
   Whether that second mechanism earns its complexity is open.
2. *What to keep.* A whole trace is the honest thing to aggregate and the expensive thing to hold.
   One frame is not obviously the right one — the top frame is codec internals, and the frame that
   would have named the Lucene mistake was six deep. Probably: keep the whole trace, aggregate by
   the deepest frame belonging to a package the user named.
3. *How it reports.* The point is one sentence — *"of the time outside every label, the largest
   single place is X, at 31% of it"* — not a flame graph. A second table would undo the reason this
   design exists.
4. *Whether it stays off by default.* It is diagnostics about the placement, not measurement, and
   the measurement must never depend on it.

**The line it crosses, deliberately.** It makes the tool a stack profiler in a small way. The
argument for doing it anyway is that this is diagnostics *about the placement*, not the measurement:
no sampled stack ever enters a share, and the measurement stays an integer in a slot. Worth crossing
knowingly rather than by accident.

## 15. Make cross-checking a first-class feature, not a trial-only exercise · open

Both trials turned on comparing our labels against an independent measurement, and on Lucene the
comparison found *our* error rather than the other tool's. Every user placing labels in code they do
not own has the same exposure and none of the harness. Two thoughts, neither worked out: a documented
recipe (record JFR over the same window, collapse the stacks, compare inclusive shares against the
label shares) shipped as part of the README rather than as trial code; or a mode that records both
at once and prints them side by side, which is more use and considerably more work.

## 16. Per-operation concurrency, which we already collect and throw away · promoted

Each tick photographs every thread at one instant, so it already knows *how many* threads were
inside operation X at that moment. Today that is summed into occupancy and the distribution is
discarded. Kept instead, it gives per operation: *2.7 threads inside on average; one thread 18% of
the time, eight threads 4% of the time.*

**No stack profiler can produce this, and the reason is structural.** async-profiler, JFR and
everything else sample each thread on its own timer signal, so they never hold all threads at one
instant — the information is destroyed before the question can be asked. Our sampler walks every
slot in one pass, so it has it for free. [plan.md](plan.md) already says this about the
whole-application coefficient in phase 6; the per-operation version is the same observation one
level down and needs nothing phase 6 needs.

**What it costs:** one counter per operation per tick, on the sampler's own arrays — the same shape
as the long-instance detector's `prev*` arrays, and nothing on the hot path.

**And it is not a curiosity — it is half of the fix for occupancy not being elapsed time.** Recording
each thread's *state* splits an operation's occupancy into working and waiting, and that alone is not
enough: a hundred threads waiting one second and one thread waiting a hundred seconds are both a
hundred thread-seconds of waiting, with real costs a hundredfold apart. Concurrency is the divisor
that separates them — `elapsed = occupancy ÷ mean concurrency while active` — and on a lock holding
100 thread-seconds it is the difference between *6.7 seconds, break up the convoy* and *59 seconds,
design the contention out*. Same total, opposite fix. The derivation and its three surviving limits
are in [profiler.md](profiler.md#turning-occupancy-back-into-wall-time). So this item and the thread
state that phase 6 exists for are **halves of one feature**, and neither is much use shipped alone.

**What is unsettled:** whether it wants a full histogram or only the mean — the mean is all the
divisor above needs, and a histogram is what distinguishes *steadily three busy* from *sawtooth
spiking to sixteen*, which [plan.md](plan.md) phase 6 already wants for the whole application.

## 17. The report presents CPU as the truth and occupancy as the approximation · promoted, done

*A framing defect, not a measurement one. Nothing here is wrong; it reads as though the wrong
quantity is the goal.*

The duty line says *"threads were on CPU 18.8% of sampled wall time — at most 81.2 pp of any share
is occupancy that was not CPU"*, and the column footer says *"share is of labelled samples and is
occupancy, not CPU"*. Both read as an apology: CPU is the real number and occupancy is what we
managed to get.

That is backwards for most of what anyone profiles. Three quantities are in play and only the first
two are ever wanted:

| quantity | a 200 ms request that computes for 5 ms and waits for a database | answers |
|---|---|---|
| wall time | 200 ms | why is this slow for the user |
| CPU | 5 ms | why is the machine saturated |
| **occupancy — what we measure** | 200 ms | — |

Occupancy counts waiting *in full*, which is the right behaviour for the latency question. So the
reason the duty cycle exists is not that CPU is the goal. It is that **summed occupancy is only
additive when it is CPU**: a hundred threads parked one second on one lock is a hundred seconds of
occupancy and one second of real cost, because waiting is simultaneous and cycles are not.

So the line should say what it is actually guarding against — *this total may be counting the same
wait many times* — rather than implying a CPU measurement was the objective and was missed. Also
open: the same line's denominators are wrong, which is item 10, and the two are worth fixing in one
pass since they are the same two sentences of output.

## 18. The imbalance count is per process, and everything beside it is per session · fixed

*Noticed while writing the leak check for 1a, which had to expect the wrong number to pass.*

`Profiler.imbalances` is an `AtomicInteger` that is never reset, so a second session in the same
process reports the first session's leaks as well as its own. Every other number in a `Report` is
per session — deliberately, and at some cost: `callsAtStart` exists precisely because call counts
that spanned the warm-up were inflating implied durations by a tenth, and that mismatch was found
only because it made an upper bound come out *below* the truth, which is arithmetically impossible.

This one has no such tell. It fails quietly, in the direction of over-reporting, and only in a
process that profiles twice — which our harnesses do and a library's users certainly will.

**Fixed** — and it was live, not latent: the Netty A/B runs a session per arm per round in one JVM,
so it had been reporting earlier arms' leaks. Found by code review. The fix is the shape
`callsAtStart` already uses: snapshot at `start()`, subtract at `stop()`.
`openAtEnd` is fine as it is, being a count of live slots rather than an accumulator. Not done with
1a because 1a was about which rung of the ladder a finding sits on, not about what a session is.

## 19. Narrow the duty bound where the state read is blind · open

*From Step 2. The bound is sound in every regime and useless in one, and the missing evidence may
already be collected.*

An event loop is off the CPU inside `epoll_wait` and reads `RUNNABLE`, so the state column cannot
see it and the duty bound has to assume all of it was inside the labels. On Netty that is 34.4% of
thread-time assumed against labels covering 13.9%, and the bound collapses. The report says so
rather than pretending, but "we cannot tell you" is not the end of the question.

**What might narrow it, cheapest first.**

1. **The long-execution detector already disagrees.** Netty's labelled operations sit at 0.00–0.01%
   of occupancy inside executions that outlived a tick, and `decode` reads 2.4 µs implied per call.
   An operation that never spans a tick cannot contain a millisecond of `epoll_wait`. That is not
   yet a bound — many short waits are not excluded — but it is evidence pointing the opposite way
   from the assumption, and the two are printed in the same report without ever being compared.
2. **Ask which labels are open when the thread is off the CPU.** The sampler knows the slot's
   current operation at every tick and it knows the thread state; what it cannot see is the
   *invisible* off-CPU, by definition. A cheap proxy: an operation whose implied per-call duration
   is far above its configured or expected size is where the waiting went. Requires an expectation,
   which the fine tier does not have for foreign code.
3. **Let the user label the wait.** The honest answer may be that the fix belongs to the placement,
   not to the instrument: a label around the selector loop turns invisible off-CPU into labelled
   occupancy, and the bound becomes tight for everything else. The report already recommends this.
   Whether the coarse tier makes it natural is a phase 4 question.

**The general shape of the problem** is that we have three instruments for off-CPU time — the CPU
clock (sees everything, per thread, no attribution), the state read (attributes per sample, blind to
native waits and preemption) and the long-execution detector (attributes per sample, floor of one
tick) — and the report presents them side by side without ever making them argue. See also item 15,
cross-checking as a first-class feature.

## 20. The report's own punctuation is unreadable on a Windows console · **done**

Every em-dash in `render()` prints as `�` here. Confirmed on a plain `--demo` run:

```
elapsed is wall clock with at least one thread inside, and in flight is occupancy / elapsed �
in flight counts EXECUTIONS at once, over the threads there were � never threads spent on one
```

The cause is the JVM writing UTF-8 to a console on a legacy codepage, and **the library cannot fix
it by setting an encoding**: `render()` returns a `String` and the caller does the printing. So the
only reliable fix is at the source — ASCII punctuation in every string the report emits.

Not acted on because it is a decision about the project's typography rather than a defect to patch:
the alternative is to keep the dashes and tell users to run `chcp 65001`, which is a worse answer
for a tool whose whole output is a block of text somebody reads in a terminal. The report is the
product; a mangled character in every user's terminal is not cosmetic.

Noticed while adding the coarse floor check, whose own message now uses plain hyphens so as not to
add to it. Roughly forty strings in `Report.kt`, plus the bench's own printing.

**Done, 2026-08-30, after it was hit for real.** It sat here as *open* on the grounds that it was
cosmetic. It is not, and the screenshot is the argument: the mangled character lands exactly where a
sentence explains *why*, because that is what a dash is for.

```
CPU duty cycle: unavailable ? no window completed
nothing was sampled ? 4 ticks is too few
```

Sixteen printed strings in the library and fifty-three in the bench and trials carried an em-dash, an
ellipsis or a `×`. All replaced with ASCII.

**The library cannot fix this at the other end.** `render()` returns a `String` and the caller decides
what encoding it is printed with, so forcing UTF-8 is not available to us — the only reliable answer
is to emit nothing that needs an encoding.

**Guarded by a test rather than by discipline.** `every line the report can print is ASCII` runs
every message builder and a report carrying every optional block, and fails on any character above
127. That is what stops it coming back, since the next em-dash will be typed by somebody who never
read this entry.

## 21. The report tells you to add a coarse label you have already added · open

Found the moment the coarse tier was pointed at Calcite. The long-instance detector's verdict says:

```
! phase:optimise: 25 executions lasted over a tick ... the share is honest and the operation
  wants a coarse label for its per-execution statistics
```

and `phase:optimise` **has** a coarse label — the run that printed this was measuring its span at
7.73 ms with percentiles. Advice to do a thing you have just done reads as the tool not knowing what
it is looking at, and it is on the one line the reader is most likely to act on.

Harder to fix than it looks, because the two tiers have **separate id spaces and independent names**:
Calcite registers `phase:optimise` fine and `optimise` coarse, and nothing connects them. Matching on
the name would be wrong the moment somebody names them differently, which is the normal case.

Options, none chosen:

- **Match on occupancy.** If some coarse type's inclusive occupancy equals this operation's within
  noise, the same boundary is labelled twice and the advice is already taken. Robust to naming,
  fragile where a coarse type happens to have a similar size.
- **Say what is true instead of giving advice**: *"N% of its samples fell under coarse `plan`, where
  per-execution statistics already exist."* Weaker advice, always correct, and computable exactly
  from the pair matrix the sampler already keeps.
- **Let the caller declare it** — `register("x", coarse = id)` — which is exact and pushes work onto
  the user for a diagnostic they did not ask for.

The second is the most in keeping with the rest of the report, which prefers stating a measurement
to issuing an instruction.

## 22. Vary the thread count and re-run — the counterfactual for parallelism · open, one data point

The sibling of item 1. That one asks *what would removing this operation save* by disabling it and
re-running; this asks **what is parallelism buying** by changing the thread count and re-running.
Same experimental shape, different knob, and neither is answerable from a single run at any amount of
instrumentation.

**It has already happened once, by accident.** The Lucene revisit ran the same coarse label at one
thread and at eight:

```
threads 1   span 14.88 ms   busy/exec 14.87 ms   waiting  0.0%
threads 8   span  4.10 ms   busy/exec  3.10 ms   waiting 24.5%
```

Three things fall out of two rows:

**A speedup curve per logical operation.** 3.63× on eight threads. Inverted through Amdahl the serial
fraction is about 17%, which caps this search at roughly **5.8× however many threads you add**. That
is a property of the code, and it is exactly the sort of number the `in flight` column cannot be —
see the load-versus-code argument under phase 5 in [plan.md](plan.md). *Back-of-envelope: two points,
and the clock moved between them.*

**A propagation check that needs no propagation.** The work a query does should not depend on how many
threads run it, so `busy/exec` ought to be invariant under the sweep. It fell 14.87 → 3.10 ms, which
is **11.8 ms of work escaping the context**, measured, with nothing implemented. That invariant —
*work per execution must not depend on thread count* — is the cheapest sharp test phase 5 could have,
and it should be an assertion the moment propagation lands.

**And it survives phase 5 rather than being replaced by it.** Propagation reports the parallelism you
*are* getting, from one run; the sweep reports the **curve**, which is what says whether more threads
would help. Different questions.

### Can the harness control a foreign target's threading?

Where the target exposes the knob, which is most of the time but not all:

| target | knob | |
|---|---|---|
| Lucene | the pool is constructed by our own `Bed` | already done — which is why the experiment was free |
| Netty | event-loop count is a constructor argument | easy |
| Calcite | single-threaded | nothing to vary |
| anything that spawns threads internally with no setting | — | **not possible from outside** |

There is a blunt fallback — CPU affinity, or `ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism` — but it is a
*different experiment*: it changes how many cores the work has, not how many threads the code uses,
so it measures resource contention rather than fan-out. Worth keeping the two apart.

### Three caveats that decide whether it is trustworthy

1. **Thread count changes the machine as well as the code.** All-core clock sits below single-core
   boost — measured at ×1.126–1.453 and already named *the price of parallelism* — so a 3.63×
   speedup contains a clock change. Every sweep point needs its clock trace beside it, which
   `CLAUDE.md` now requires anyway.
2. **Offline only, and the workload must be repeatable.** The same constraint item 1 carries, and it
   keeps this a developer's mode rather than anything that could run in production.
3. **The knob is usually per-process, not per-operation.** Two coarse types sharing one pool cannot be
   varied independently, so this gives a curve for the whole run. The disable-and-re-run
   counterfactual can target one operation; this generally cannot.

**Where it would start:** the invariant, not the curve. It is cheaper, it is a pass/fail rather than a
number needing interpretation, and phase 5 needs it.

## 23. A graph-traversal bench, the shape the project came from · descoped from phase 5

The project came from an in-memory supply-chain traversal: nanosecond operations, repeated billions
of times, crossing coroutine suspensions. It is the exact shape this tool was built for and the one
shape no trial covers, and [plan.md](plan.md) put a bench of it inside phase 5, on the argument that
what it uniquely exercises — work crossing threads and suspending — has nothing to test until
propagation exists.

**Taken out of phase 5, for a reason plan.md had already written down.** The original is under NDA,
so what can be built is a reproduction of it from the public form of the problem. That makes it our
code, inheriting our assumptions, which is the same document's stated reason it *"cannot substitute
for pointing the tool at somebody else's"*. It is then neither the real workload nor a trial, and
phase 5 already gets its known truth from the bench's fork/join mode and its real-code verdict from
Lucene at eight threads. A third thing that is a weaker version of both is not worth the phase.

**What would change the answer.** If the public form of the problem becomes writable in enough
detail to be more than a synthetic fan-out — the branching factor, the suspension pattern, the
sharing between traversals — then it stops being a weaker fork/join bench and becomes the workload,
and it is worth building. The suspension half in particular is not covered by anything else here:
the bench's fan-out is threads handing work to threads, while a suspended coroutine occupies no
thread at all, and phase 5 has to decide deliberately what a span means across one.

## 24. Measure CPU per label, instead of bounding thread state after the fact · **closed: the clock is too coarse**

Trial 4 measured `working` reading **55x** more CPU than the operating system says the process spent,
because Java reports a thread inside a native call as `RUNNABLE` and a socket read is a native call.
The report now prints the duty-cycle ceiling beside the number and warns — see
[trial-jdbc.md](trial-jdbc.md) — but that says the figure cannot be trusted; it does not produce a
better one.

**The better one would be CPU time attributed per label.** `ThreadMXBean.getThreadCpuTime` counts
time on a processor and sees through the JNI boundary that thread state cannot, so a sampler that
read it would get `working` right by construction instead of bounding it afterwards.

**Why it is not simply done.** The duty machinery already measures the cost: **130.9 µs for a walk**
of the live threads, which is why it runs once a second and not once a tick. At a 1 ms step that is
13% of the sampling thread's budget spent on one reading, against a design whose whole claim is that
the observer costs nothing the workload can feel.

**Three shapes it could take, none measured:**

- **Delta per thread per window, split by where the thread was.** The duty walk already produces a
  per-thread CPU delta once a second; the sampler knows which labels that thread was inside during
  the window. Attribute the delta in proportion. Cheap, and an approximation whose error is worth
  measuring rather than assuming.
- **A second, slower clock for the coarse tier only.** Coarse executions last milliseconds, so a
  per-execution CPU reading at entry and exit is two `getThreadCpuTime` calls against a span of
  microseconds — plausible where it is hopeless for a 20 ns fine label. It would only work for a
  span that stays on one thread, which after phase 5 is not the interesting case.
- **The platform's own counters.** JFR's `ThreadCPULoad`, or perf on Linux. Foreign machinery, and
  the JFR output in phase 8 has to be built anyway.

**Measured, and it is closed.** `--cpucost` on 2026-08-30: a call for another thread costs
**284.7 ns** and a walk of eight threads **2.3 µs**, which is 0.2% of a 1 ms step. Cost was never the
obstacle, and the 130.9 µs this entry was written around is not a call cost at all — it is the
*dearest walk observed over a run*, which overstated the price by about 57x.

**What closes it is the resolution: 15.625 ms, sixteen times the sampling step.** A clock advancing
in quanta that large cannot attribute time to a millisecond however cheap it is to read, and no
implementation gets around a scheduler quantum. Per-window CPU survives — that is what the duty cycle
already is, and what `working`'s ceiling is computed from — and per-tick, per-label and
per-execution attribution do not. Recorded in
[findings.md](findings.md#reading-a-threads-cpu-is-cheap-its-clock-is-16x-too-coarse-to-use-per-tick).

**What would reopen it:** a platform whose per-thread CPU clock is finer than the sampling step.
Linux's `clock_gettime(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID)` is nanosecond-resolution on paper, so the same
measurement on Linux might come out differently — and the answer would then be *platform-dependent*,
which is its own thing to report rather than a fix.

## 25. Coroutine propagation, and the reason a suspended coroutine is the easy case · deferred

Phase 5f was going to be a `profiler-coroutines` module: a `ThreadContextElement` that mounts the
captured context on every resume and restores it on every suspension. It is not built, for the reason
that descoped item 23 — the mechanism is [withCoarse] under another name, and without a coroutine
workload to point it at it would be a mechanism nobody has watched work on anything real.

**What it would have taught us is worth more than the module, and none of it needs the module.**

### A suspended coroutine occupies no thread, so it is the one wait this tool cannot get wrong

Three ways of waiting, and the tool has now met all three:

| | what the sampler sees | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| a thread blocked in a socket read | a thread, `RUNNABLE`, holding the context | **wrong by 55x**, [trial 4](trial-jdbc.md) |
| a thread parked on a join | a thread, `WAITING` | correct |
| **a suspended coroutine** | **nothing at all** | correct, and it cannot be otherwise |

That inverts the expectation the plan carried. Coroutines were filed under *hazard* — item 8 lists
them first among the ways attribution breaks — but for the **coarse** tier they are the benign case.
The blindness trial 4 found cannot arise, because there is no thread to misread. Waiting is visible
as absence rather than as a state that has to be interrogated, and absence is not something
`Thread.getState` can lie about.

It is also an argument about workloads rather than about profilers, and worth saying out loud: *an
application that suspends instead of blocking is easier to measure honestly.*

### `inside` counts threads, and a coroutine user will read it as coroutines

A request fanned across a hundred coroutines on four dispatcher threads reads `inside <= 4`. That is
honest — the column is documented as *threads in one execution* — but it is not the number a
coroutine user expects, and the gap between "concurrent pieces of work" and "threads carrying them"
is exactly what coroutines exist to open up. Whatever the module eventually looks like, the column
needs a sentence about this.

### The fine tier's safety with coroutines is still an argument, not a measurement

Item 8 reasons that `op(id) { }` is structurally safe because a suspending body is by construction
not fine-grained: a suspension point costs a continuation allocation and a dispatch, hundreds of
nanoseconds, against the tens the fine tier exists for. Sound, and never tested. A coroutine workload
could put a label around a suspending body on purpose and watch what happens, which is the only way
that claim stops being a claim.

**What would change the answer:** a real coroutine workload to point it at. Item 23's, if it ever
becomes writable, or a third-party one — the same standard every other trial here is held to.

## 26. Calling this from Java · in scope, deferred to phase 7

**Java callers are in scope.** They are also, today, accidentally supported rather than designed
for — and the value-class change in the API refactor would take them from *awkward* to *impossible*
unless something is done about it. Written down here so the decision is made deliberately in phase 7
rather than inherited from whichever Kotlin feature was reached for.

### Where it stands today

`Profiler` is a Kotlin `object`, so everything is `Profiler.INSTANCE.x()`:

```java
int parse = Profiler.INSTANCE.register("parse");
Profiler.INSTANCE.enter(parse);
try { ... } finally { Profiler.INSTANCE.exit(); }
```

That works. Two things about it do not:

- **`op(id) { }` is effectively Kotlin-only.** Java sees `ProfilerKt.op(int, Function0)`, and an
  inline function is *not* inlined for a Java caller — every call is a real invocation plus a
  `Function0` allocation. The 2 ns hook exists because C2 inlines the wrapper away; from Java none of
  that happens. So a Java user is pushed onto `enter`/`exit`, which is the form with no `finally` and
  the leak hazard the docs warn about hardest.
- **`start()` has default parameters**, so Java gets `start$default(INSTANCE, 1.0, null, 0.0, false,
  false, 0b11110, null)` unless it passes all five.

### What the refactor does to it, and the fix

Value classes mangle in **both** parameter and return position:

```
public final int registerFine-0JTvllc(java.lang.String);
public final void enter-_c7NGOw(int);
```

`-` is not a legal character in a Java identifier, so `javac` cannot call these at all. Not ugly —
uncallable, short of reflection.

`@JvmName` restores a clean surface, verified:

```kotlin
@JvmName("registerFine") fun registerFine(name: String): FineOp
```
```
public final int registerFine(java.lang.String);   // plain int, callable
```

### What phase 7 should decide

1. `@JvmName` on every entry point that takes or returns a handle — about eight functions.
2. A Java-friendly `start` overload without default parameters.
3. Whether to give Java a cheap block form at all. The honest answer may be *no*: without inlining
   there is no cheap block form to give, and the right advice is `enter`/`exit` plus
   `expectBalanced()`. That is a documentation decision, not an API one.
4. **A Java source file in the test suite that actually compiles against the API.** Without one,
   nobody finds out it broke — which is exactly how it got into this state.

## 27. Say at `start()` what the run is too short to answer · open

From the [sandbox friction log](sandbox.md), and the first thing anyone does: a small loop, to see
what happens. On this machine a fixed 2,000 iterations is 0.2 s, and the report comes back with 26
samples, **19.6% noise**, and the duty cycle reporting itself *"unavailable — no window completed
(the run is shorter than 1.000 s)"*.

Everything it says is true and clearly flagged. The flags arrive **after** the run.

`Profiler.start()` already knows its own step and the duty cycle's one-second window. It could say,
at the moment it is called, that a run under about a second will produce no duty cycle and therefore
no bound on any share — which is the difference between a report a reader can use and one they
cannot.

**What is unclear, and why this is not simply obvious.** `start()` does not know how long the run
will be, so the warning would have to be unconditional — *"runs under a second produce no bound"* —
printed every time, including the thousands of times it is irrelevant. A warning nobody needs is how
a tool teaches people to skip its warnings. The alternatives: print it at `stop()` when the run was
in fact too short (which is where it already is), or have `start()` take an expected duration it can
check against, which puts a parameter on the hot path of the API for a diagnostic.

**Worth deciding with phase 7**, which is where the surface gets hardened, rather than patched now.

## 28. Self time for coarse operations · open

From the sandbox, 2026-08-31, asking the question that decides how the coarse table should be
sorted: *which one is the worst - the one to improve?*

The answer is total time, executions x mean, and the table now sorts by it and prints it. But that
total is **inclusive**: the sampler credits occupancy by walking the parent chain, and a measured
span contains every span opened inside it. So a parent always sorts above its own children, and its
total is by definition the sum of what is inside it plus its own work. Ranked that way, the
outermost context wins every time and tells you nothing - which is the classic inclusive-vs-self
problem, arriving here for the first time because the coarse tier only recently got a ranking at all.

**What self time would be:** the span total minus the totals of the coarse spans opened inside it.
Time the operation spent on its own work rather than in something else that is also labelled.

**Why it is not a small change.** Nothing today keeps per-context nested accounting. `CoarseContext`
knows its `parent`, so a child could subtract itself from its parent's running total when it closes,
which is the cheap version and costs one add on the close path. The complications are the ones this
project has met before:

- **Work that crosses threads.** A span propagated to a pool closes on another thread, and its
  parent chain is the forked one. Subtracting it from a parent still running elsewhere is a race,
  and the existing stale-execution handling shows that case is real rather than theoretical.
- **A type nested inside itself.** Inclusive occupancy already deduplicates by type when walking the
  chain; a self-time subtraction has to make the same choice, and it is not obviously the same one.
- **It is only meaningful when spans actually nest.** With one coarse label - which is most first
  uses - self and inclusive are identical, and the column would be a duplicate.

**Not committed.** The inclusive total is the right key while there is no self time to sort by, and
it is honest as long as the table says which it is.

## 29. The `Calls` band repeats a column inside it · open

From the sandbox on 2026-09-01, and explicitly provisional - *"just name the group Calls for now"*.

The fine table's columns are banded into `Load`, `Spread`, `Calls` and `Trust`. The third band names
the group after the noun its own first column already carries, which reads as a stutter. It is there
because the group's natural name **is** that noun: the pair answers *how big is one call*, and the
columns are `Calls` and `Thread-time per call`.

Three ways out, none picked:

- **Rename the column to `Count`**, with the band acting as a shared prefix - *Calls: count,
  thread-time per call*. Reads well, but makes one band work differently from the other three, which
  are categories rather than prefixes.
- **Leave the band empty.** Once the column said `Thread-time per call` rather than `Impl/call`, the
  two heads announce their own kinship and the bars alone group them. This suggests a rule worth
  having: *label a group only when its columns do not say it themselves.*
- **Find a fourth word.** `Size` was tried and rejected - `Calls` is a count, not a size, and the
  name was carried entirely by the column beside it.

## 30. The other three tables have no bands · open

Only the fine table is grouped. The coarse table has eight columns and would take the same treatment;
the header block is key-value rows and probably should not. The `band`, `rule` and `layout` helpers
are already general over a width array and a set of break points, so this is a decision about whether
the coarse table's columns fall into groups at all, not a piece of work.

## 31. `Over 1t` was never examined · open

It survived a session that renamed or removed every other column in the fine table - `occupancy`,
`elapsed`, `in flight`, `waiting`, `Impl/call` - purely because nobody asked about it. It is the
share of an operation's thread-time spent inside executions that outlived a tick, and the name says
none of that. It is in the same family as the names that did get fixed, and the only reason it is
still there is that the reader ran out of questions first.

## 32. The long-execution line says nothing on a small run · open

Printed unconditionally under the coarse table:

```
  run-wide 99.86%, of which the machine itself accounts for up to 99.93% (preemption and GC pauses)
```

On the sandbox run this is true and useless. Every execution was 1.4 seconds against a 1 ms step, so
of course they all spanned a tick; the baseline is 99.86% and the machine floor above it, and the
comparison the line exists to support - *is this operation stuck more often than the run as a whole* -
has nothing to say when the answer is *everything, always*. Noticed on 2026-08-31 and not followed up.

## 33. `render(unicode = true)` · open

Offered when Andrey asked whether the sort marker could be a real arrow rather than `v`, and not
taken. The library cannot know the encoding of the sink - `render()` returns a `String` and somebody
else prints it - so the only safe default is ASCII. An explicit opt-in would move that decision to a
caller who does know, and would let the report use an arrow, a proper dash and box-drawing rules for
the bars. It also doubles the surface the ASCII test has to cover.

## 34. What bounds the step, above and below - and whether the user should be choosing it · open

`stepMillis` is presented as a dial the caller turns, and everything this project has ever measured
was taken at the one value, 1 ms. The evidence already collected says the usable range is narrow and
that its edges are set by the *workload*, not by taste - which makes a free-form parameter the wrong
shape for it. Raised by Andrey from the newest entry in the [sandbox friction log](sandbox.md):
*"should we not find a proper value and fix it?"*

**The floor is the machine, and it is close.** At a 1 ms request with 8 workers on 16 cores the
spinning sampler achieves **1.001 ms with one resync**, while `parkNanos` achieves 1.62 ms with 2534
resyncs of 6177 and degrades to **13.5 ms** with every core loaded ([findings.md](findings.md),
"Parking cannot hold a millisecond step"). Spin holds 1 ms; nothing below 1 ms has ever been
measured here. And the once-a-second thread-CPU walk costs up to **214.7 us** - already a fifth of a
1 ms tick, and larger than a whole tick at any step below about 0.2 ms, at which point the duty
cycle's own instrument would be displacing the samples it exists to bound.

**The ceiling is the thread count, and the tool knows it and the user does not.** The sampler walks
every registered slot every tick: **0.2% of a 1 ms step at 8 threads**, and about **95 us - 10% of
the step - at the 1024-slot ceiling**. So past some thread count 1 ms is itself the wrong default
and the step should be *raised*, which is the opposite of the direction everyone reaches for. The
number that decides this is the live slot count, which the profiler observes at run time and the
caller has to guess before `start()`.

**And there is a third bound that is not about cost at all**: a step only buys a table if the run
lasts `MIN_TICKS_FOR_A_TABLE` (50) ticks, and a share is only worth reading well above that. Step
and duration multiply, so the same report is unreadable for two unrelated reasons that currently
produce two unrelated messages.

**What could be built, in increasing order of nerve.**

1. *Say when the step did not hold.* Mostly there: the report prints achieved beside requested, plus
   the resync count. What is missing is the sentence that reads them - a step the OS could not hold
   is a defect in the run, not a statistic.
2. *Warn when the walk is eating the tick.* Slot count x per-slot walk against the step is a live
   number, and 10% of the step going to the sampler is worth saying out loud.
3. *Stop asking.* Derive the step from the observed slot count and keep it inside the affordable
   band, leaving `stepMillis` as an override for people who know why they want one. This is the one
   that matches the evidence - the affordable step is a function of something the tool measures -
   and also the one that would need a real experiment behind it, because a step that changes
   mid-run changes what `hits x step` means.

**What is unresolved.** Nothing below 1 ms has been characterised at all, so the floor above is
inferred from adjacent measurements rather than measured: the honest first step is a sweep of
achieved step and resync count at 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 ms at a few thread counts, which the bench
can already run (`--step`). Item 27 is the same shape of problem - a diagnostic that can only be
stated after the run - and if either is built they should be built together.

## 35. Tooling for the Universal Scalability Law - sweep the thread count and fit it · open

Andrey's, 2026-09-02. The profiler answers *where did the time go at this thread count*. The
question underneath most performance work is *what happens when I add threads*, and there is a
standard model for it - Gunther's Universal Scalability Law:

```
X(N) = lambda*N / (1 + sigma*(N-1) + kappa*N*(N-1))
```

**lambda** is one worker's throughput, **sigma** is the serialized fraction (Amdahl on its own), and
**kappa** is coherency - the cost of workers keeping each other consistent. Kappa grows as N^2, so
it bends the curve back down: the retrograde region where more threads do less work. A fit gives the
peak, which is the number a reader actually wants.

**Why it belongs here rather than in a spreadsheet.** A USL fit on total throughput says *the system
stops scaling at 24 threads* and nothing about why. This tool already measures, per operation and at
every N, the two things the model only infers: the **runnable/wait split**, which is contention
made visible, and **concurrency** - threads inside an operation at once. So the interesting output
is not one curve but a curve *per label*, with the operations whose waiting share grows with N named
as the candidates for sigma, and the ones whose implied per-call duration grows with N as the
candidates for kappa - a cache line getting hotter costs time per call without anyone waiting on a
lock. That decomposition is the thing no throughput fit can do, and it is a short step from numbers
we already print.

**What would have to exist.**

1. A driver that runs the same workload at several thread counts. The bench already takes
   `--threads` and has a sweep mode, so the *bench* could do this today; a user's workload could not,
   for the same reason item 1 cannot re-run theirs - the tool does not own the loop. The honest first
   version is bench-only, and it is worth knowing whether that is interesting or circular.
2. A throughput number the profiler can see. Today it counts calls, which is a throughput
   denominator only if the caller says which operation is the unit of work.
3. The fit, three parameters over the sweep, with the residuals shown rather than a bare peak.

**The objection that has to be answered first, and it is this machine.** A sweep is a *series of
runs*, and CLAUDE.md exists partly because a series of runs on this laptop cannot be compared: the
clock swings 2x within a run, heat soak decayed one configuration from 23M to 12M calls/s over an
hour, and idling restored it. Points taken at N=1,2,4,8,16 in that order have the machine cooling
and heating monotonically *along the x axis*, which manufactures exactly the retrograde curve USL is
famous for finding. Any sweep would have to interleave thread counts rather than walk them, repeat
each point, and carry the processor-performance trace beside every point - and even then the fit
would need the clock as a covariate before kappa means anything.

There is already a hint of this in [findings.md](findings.md): one spinning thread reads 98.81% on
CPU, eight read 95.57%, and eight plus the sampler read 90.08%. That is a descheduling curve against
N taken for another purpose, and it is the shape sigma would have to be separated from.

**Walking the sweep downwards does not fix it - it flips the sign.** Andrey's question, and worth
recording because the answer is not obvious. Ascending, the high-N points run last and hottest, so
they read low, the curve bends down and kappa is inflated: a fake retrograde region, which at least
looks alarming enough to investigate. Descending, N=1 runs last and slowest, so **lambda** is
underestimated and every other point looks good against it - the fit comes back flattering, with
small sigma and small kappa, and a result that says *you scale fine* is the one nobody re-checks.
The drift is not even monotone in that direction, because heat tracks the load rather than the
clock: 16 threads front-loads it, and the 1-2 thread points then run on a machine that is partly
recovering, which is harder to correct for than a straight trend.

So interleaving with repeats is the fix. But running the sweep in **both** directions is worth doing
as the instrument: fit ascending and descending separately, and the gap between the two fits
measures how far the machine moved during the sweep. Agreement makes the sweep trustworthy;
disagreement is thermal, and no amount of fitting recovers it.

**Open.** Is the fit the product, or is the per-label decomposition the product and the fit merely
the headline? Does anyone believe a three-parameter fit on five noisy points? And it may be that the
useful half is much smaller: print the per-operation table *at two thread counts side by side* and
let the reader see which label grew, which is item 1's counterfactual shape without the model.

## 36. `Workers` is a lower bound and the row does not say so · open

The `Workers` column invites one specific reading, which is the argument for having it: *I
dispatched three, it says two, something is off.* The reading is right often enough to be worth
printing - and it can also be manufactured by the sampler, because `Workers` is `max(k)` over ticks
and two threads that overlap for 3% of a run will frequently show 1. The evidence that would settle
it is already on the row - `Hits` and `Noise`, two columns to the right - and nothing connects them.
The serialization warning is gated at `MIN_HITS_FOR_SERIAL` for exactly this reason; the column
itself is gated at nothing.

**Three different things produce a low `Workers`, and the column says the same word for all of
them.**

1. **Undersampling.** The overlap was real and brief, and no tick landed in it.
2. **Serialization.** Threads queue through one at a time - a lock, or a single-threaded stage. This
   is the one the warning names.
3. **The work is shorter than the handover.** Andrey's, from the sandbox: *"as the op is super tiny
   it takes the same or less than the thread work handover, so what seems to be multithreading is
   effectively serialized - before a new thread even gets the work, the previous one is over."* The
   pool is wide, the tasks are dispatched, and they still never overlap, because a `submit` costs
   more than the body.

**Two runs of the same sandbox in one session are the evidence for the third**, and they differ only
in the size of the work inside the label:

| work per call | Concurrency | Workers | Pool |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~200 ns loop | 1.01 | 2 | 4 |
| 691 ms loop | 2.99 | 3 | 4 |

Same structure, same pool, three tasks dispatched per round in both. With a big enough body the pool
parallelizes exactly as written; with a tiny one it degenerates to a serial queue with extra steps.
That is a real finding about a real program, and a profiler that could name it would be earning its
place - the numbers it needs are the ones already in the row.

**Ways out, none costed yet.** Print `>= 2` rather than `2` when the hits cannot exclude more.
Report the share of active ticks with two or more threads inside rather than only the maximum, which
separates *brief overlap* from *never overlapped* without a threshold. Or say the third case out
loud when it is visible - an operation whose `Thread-time per call` is at or under the cost of a
dispatch, spread across a `Pool` larger than its `Workers`, is dispatch-bound, and the fix is
batching rather than more threads.

**Related:** the same "how does this scale" question from the modelling end is item 35, and the
serialization case is the sigma term named there.

## 37. Own time in the coarse table, and the subtraction that must not be invited · open

Andrey, after the merged table landed: *"probably in the coarse table we should show both - total
and own time."* Right, and the obvious version is wrong in a way worth writing down before someone
builds it.

**The trap.** `Total` in the coarse table is the sum of **measured spans** - elapsed time per
execution. Own time is **sampled thread-time**. Side by side they invite `Total - Own = delegated`,
which holds only while each execution runs on one thread. Under fan-out it fails exactly where the
coarse tier is most interesting: a request whose helpers work three threads for 10 ms has a span
total of 10 ms and a thread-time of 30 ms, so the subtraction can come out negative.

**The version that works.** Pair like with like - own thread-time against *inclusive* thread-time,
both sampled, both already computed. The inclusive figure is on the line under the table, so it is
one clause:

```
  request: 99.6% of the thread-time inside operations INCLUDING what it contains, 478 s of it,
           of which 24.1 s (5.03%) was its own work
```

That also puts the reconciliation for the two `request` rows on one line: the 5.03% here is the
5.03% in the table above, which is the number a reader needs when the merged row says concurrency
1.00 and the parallelism line says four threads per execution.

**Not a column.** Every column in the coarse table is a measured-span statistic; a sampled column
among them is the mixed-provenance table that [plan.md](plan.md) argued against when the tiers were
merged. Left open rather than built because the coarse table is about to be reworked wholesale.

## 38. Take the pauses out of thread-time and time per call · open

One sample is worth the step the sampler achieved, and pauses stretch it: 1.064 ms on a run that was
5.93% paused, so every `Thread-time` and `Thread-time per call` is 6% high
([findings.md](findings.md)). `Paused` now measures exactly the amount. Subtracting it makes time per
call the running time of a call, which is what a reader comparing it with a microbenchmark expects.

**Why it is not simply done.** `Coverage` would stop adding up to the wall clock, and the coarse
spans are timestamps and *do* include their pauses, so `mean - busy/exec` would start reporting
pauses as waiting. Both are right, and both need the report to say so. It also moves a number that
has been compared across runs.

## 39. Take the pauses out of the duty windows · built 2026-10-01

Built, as *wall time = run + paused* with time on CPU taken over run time - see
[plan.md](plan.md). The bound on the graph run went from 10.8 pp to about 1 pp, and the verdict
with it.

**Left from it:** the `Windows` range is still over wall time, so its low end is still the window
the longest pause landed in. And only what the JVM confirms is subtracted, so on a collector the
profiler cannot read the bound is as loose as before - which item 40 would lift.

## 40. Tell a stopped JVM from a preempted sampler, without asking the JVM · open

`Paused` counts every late tick. On a quiet machine that is a stopped JVM to within a percent; on a
loaded one the sampler can lose its core while the workers run on, and that is lateness with no
pause behind it. Today the `GC` row is the only check, and it only knows about collections.

**The free signal.** The sampler already reads each thread's call counter for the long-execution
check. If the counters moved across a late tick, the workers were running. It says nothing for a
thread inside one long call, so it bounds the answer rather than giving it.

## 41. Say where the pauses landed · open

The total is in the header. Which coarse execution sat through the 1.8 s collection is not, and it
is the first thing a reader of the percentiles asks. The slot still holds its label and its context
across a pause, so a late tick can be charged to both - worded as *stopped inside*, never *caused
by*, because a pause stops every thread wherever it happens to be.

GC notifications (`com.sun.management`) would add the cause and the collector's own duration per
pause. HotSpot only, and a second module to depend on.

**The harder version:** charging a collection to the operation that allocated. That needs allocated
bytes per operation - far beyond the 2 ns the fine hook costs, possibly affordable at the 40 ns of a
coarse context, and unmeasured.

## Promoted to plan.md

**Phase 3.5** is item 9 above, reframed from detecting bad operations to bounding the error on every
share at once — the CPU duty cycle and the bound it implies, the long-instance detector, implied
per-call duration, and the bench work that gives all three a known truth to be checked against.

**Phase 4** already carries these, and they came out of the trial's friction list, recorded in full
in [trial-calcite.md](trial-calcite.md#6-the-friction--what-the-trial-says-about-the-tool):

- `Profiler.enter(id)` / `Profiler.exit()` and the span stack they imply, because `op(id) { }` is a
  block and almost nothing in foreign code is ours to wrap in a block.
- A balance check for non-lexical labels, and an imbalance count in the report — a leaked label is
  silent, plausible, and contaminates in the wrong direction.
- Folding zero-hit operations, with a count of what was folded.
- The counterfactual warning in the output.
- Documenting the id-caching pattern, which is not obvious and was rediscovered under pressure.
- The coarse tier's shape: per-instance spans with percentiles, and the cross-tabulation that reads
  *of the 48 ms median plan, 40% is `FilterIntoJoinRule`*.
