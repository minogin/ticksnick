# The documents

**The project is TickSnick** — `com.ticksnick:ticksnick`, ticksnick.com. Each document has a job and
nothing is written in two places. Start with [tldr.md](tldr.md) if you have five minutes, or with
[profiler.md](profiler.md) if you want the design.

**If you are picking this up to keep using the tool rather than to build it**, go to
[sandbox.md](sandbox.md): `gradlew :sandbox:run` is a forty-line program you edit, and the friction
log there is where what you find goes. That is the loop that produced most of what changed on
2026-08-30 and 31 — a percentile larger than the maximum, a report nobody could read, characters a
Windows console cannot print, and an API where the first fine operation and the first coarse one
were both the integer 0.

**Two things to know before running anything**, because neither is discoverable from the code:

- **Any performance measurement needs the CPU clock traced beside it.** `CLAUDE.md` has the exact
  probe. This machine's clock swings 2x within a single run, and several hours have gone into
  chasing differences that were the machine changing speed.
- **Every measurement in [findings.md](findings.md) predates the Kotlin 2.4.0 bump, and every trial
  number also predates the move to JDK 21.** Nothing in the source changed with either, so nothing is
  expected to have moved — but a close comparison against an older figure should re-run `--hook`
  first. See [plan.md](plan.md), "The toolchain".

**Where we are right now.** The fine tier is built, verified and **released as v0.1.0** — Apache-2.0,
no dependencies, Java 21+. Verified on our own bench and on **four** foreign codebases: Apache
Calcite, Apache Lucene, Netty, and PostgreSQL over a socket. Phases 1, 2, 3, 3.5 and 3.75 are done; phase 6 is half done —
thread state and per-operation concurrency exist, the whole-application coefficient does not; phase 7
is far enough for a 0.x but has no annotations and no agent.

Since the trials: the three small fixes and the pause after them are **done**, and the pause earned
its place — it caught the new error bound being sound and useless on a thread pool. There is a test
suite now (84 tests, ~3 s) whose expectations are the numbers in findings.md, two code reviews have
been through every file, and `D₂` — the one outright defect the design carried — is fixed.

**Phase 4 — the coarse tier — is done**, and checked on every trial. Contexts, measured spans with
percentiles, the `(fine, coarse)` cross-tabulation, and a floor check for the tier boundary that is
*exact* where the fine one has to infer. Verified against truths that are identities rather than
estimates: the bench times every one of its own requests, the Calcite harness has timed every plan
since before this tier existed, and in both cases p50, p90 and p99 agree to **+0.00%**.

**Phase 5 — crossing threads — is done too.** Wrap a pool with `.propagating()` and work handed to it
stays inside the execution that forked it. On Lucene that took labelled time falling outside every
span from **88.5% to nothing**, with the mean span unchanged — the program was not altered, only what
could be seen of it. Two columns come with it: `inside`, the threads a request ties up, and
`working`, the ones on a CPU. Work that outlives the request that forked it is detected and excluded
rather than billed to a finished execution. The coroutines module was dropped on purpose —
[ideas.md](ideas.md) item 25.

**A fourth trial then found a defect in one of those columns.** PostgreSQL over a socket is the first
workload here that waits for anything, and `working` read **55× more CPU than the machine actually
spent**: Java reports a thread stopped inside a native call as runnable. The report now prints the
measured duty cycle beside the number and says so. [trial-jdbc.md](trial-jdbc.md).

**Since then, 2026-10-01: the report says when the JVM was stopped.** The first workload that
allocates - a graph benchmark in a separate project, `C:\idea\graph`, with TickSnick wired in as a
composite build - printed a stretched step and a low time on CPU with nothing saying why. It was
garbage collection. The header now splits wall time into *run* and *paused*, and `Time on CPU`, the
bound and the verdict are taken over run time; on that workload the bound went from about 11 pp to
0.61 pp. Decided and recorded in [plan.md](plan.md), the two entries dated 2026-10-01; measured in
[findings.md](findings.md); explained in [output.md](output.md). **Left open:** thread-time and time
per call still include the pauses ([ideas.md](ideas.md) item 38), and items 40 and 41. The bench was
not re-run after either change. That project's `docs/handover.md` says where the work on it stands.

**What to do next is [plan.md § Phase 6](plan.md#phase-6--thread-state-and-the-whole-application-coefficient--partly-done)** —
the whole-application parallelism coefficient. Its design is settled and the measurement that settled
it is recorded: reading a thread's CPU costs 285 ns, which is affordable, but the clock's resolution
is 15.625 ms, sixteen times the sampling step, so the coefficient has to be built on thread state
with the duty-cycle bound printed beside it.

**Two things worth knowing before reading anything else**, because they govern the rest:

- **The tier boundary is not a size range.** It comes from what the instrumentation costs, and it
  lands at *an operation under ~1 µs cannot be coarse*. Neither tier has an upper limit.
  [profiler.md](profiler.md#where-the-boundary-is).
- **How accurate this has to be**, which decides what is worth building: an error matters only if it
  can move the ranking or point at the wrong operation, and random noise and uniform bias can do
  neither. [profiler.md](profiler.md#how-accurate-this-has-to-be-and-where-that-budget-goes).

| document | what belongs in it | read it when |
|---|---|---|
| [tldr.md](tldr.md) | the whole project in plain words, no jargon | you want to know what this is |
| [output.md](output.md) | how to read the report — every column, every warning, and what to do about each | you have run it and want to know what you are looking at |
| [profiler.md](profiler.md) | the design and the prior art — and the **tier boundary**: which operations can be coarse, what the fine tier measures, and where it breaks | you want to know how it works and why it is shaped this way |
| [plan.md](plan.md) | work we committed to, phase by phase, rewritten as each closes to say what was actually built | you want to know where we are |
| [findings.md](findings.md) | only things we measured, each with the measurement that produced it | you want to know what is true, and why we believe it |
| [case.md](case.md) | observations of existing tools failing at something, and where they are better than us | you want to know why this exists at all |
| [trial-calcite.md](trial-calcite.md) |  Apache Calcite — the first end-to-end result on foreign code, and where the coarse tier was checked against a stopwatch the harness already had | you want the first end-to-end result on code we did not write |
| [trial-lucene.md](trial-lucene.md) | the same, Apache Lucene — concurrent, the first head-to-head against a timed-wrapper profiler, and where the coarse tier meets the edge of its own tier | you want the second, and the strongest argument for sampling we have |
| [trial-netty.md](trial-netty.md) | the same, Netty — event loops, the first test of the thread-state column on foreign code, and the negative control for the coarse tier's waiting column: it reads 0.0% because a loopback request really does not wait | you want the third, and what a flame graph does with a handler chain |
| [trial-jdbc.md](trial-jdbc.md) | the same, PostgreSQL over a socket — the first workload here with any waiting in it, and where `working` was measured wrong by 55x | you want the fourth, and the trial that found a defect in a column we had shipped |
| [sandbox.md](sandbox.md) | the friction log — where using the tool was awkward, as opposed to where its numbers were wrong | you want to know what it is like to use, or you have just been using it |
| [ideas.md](ideas.md) | things worth doing that we have not committed to | you want to know what was considered and deferred |
| [../README.md](../README.md) | how to use it and how to run the bench | you want to run something |

## The rules that keep them apart

- **findings.md takes no hunches.** A claim without a number is an open question, and it goes in the
  "Open questions" section at the end rather than in the body.
- **case.md is built from observations, not opinions.** Every entry names the tool, what it failed
  at, and where that was seen. It keeps an honest section on where the other tools are better.
- **ideas.md is written before an idea evaporates**, untested and marked as such. When one is taken
  up it is marked *promoted* and the commitment moves to plan.md.
- **plan.md carries no results**, only what we are doing and what "done" means. Results go to
  findings.md and get linked from here.

## Where the code is

| | |
|---|---|
| **`com/ticksnick/`** | **the library — everything a user imports, and nothing else** |
| `Profiler.kt` | the slot, the registry, `op { }` / `enter` / `exit`, and the constants that bound them |
| `Sampler.kt` | the sampling thread: the tick loop, the slot walk, the wait strategy |
| `Coarse.kt` | the coarse tier: the context and the span histogram. The label itself is `op { }`, the same verb the fine tier uses |
| `Operations.kt` | `FineOp` and `CoarseOp` — why the tier is chosen once, at registration, and never mentioned again |
| `Report.kt` | what a session collected and how it is rendered, including every verdict and threshold |
| `Duty.kt` | how much of the occupancy was CPU, and the bound that puts on every share |
| **`com/ticksnick/bench/`** | **the harness — never shipped, and now unable to leak into the above** |
| `Workload.kt`, `Burn.kt`, `Bench.kt` | a workload whose true answer is known |
| `Main.kt` | the modes, the run, and the bench's own tolerance table |
| `Verify.kt` | the sampler against the truth, and the observer effect |
| `VerifyCoarse.kt` | the coarse tier against the truth: counts, spans against the workers own stopwatches, the cross-tabulation, and parallelism |
| `Print.kt` | every report the bench prints about itself |
| `StackCost.kt` | what a cross-thread stack walk costs |
| **`src/test/kotlin/`** | **the arithmetic, checked without starting anything — `./gradlew test`, ~3 s** |
| `DutyBoundTest.kt` | the bound on every share: four properties, and the five regimes the trials measured |
| `FloorCheckTest.kt` | who gets named as below the floor, including both sides of the 0.35 ns boundary |
| `RegistryTest.kt` | slots, nesting, the balance check, and the one fatal condition in both directions |
| `ReportTest.kt` | shares, coverage, the long-execution floor, and what the report promises to print |
| `CoarseTest.kt` | the histogram brackets what it is given, nesting restores the parent, a leaked context is caught, and the tier boundary from the coarse side |
| `trial-calcite/` | the Calcite trial, in its own module so its dependencies cannot leak into the profiler |
| `trial-lucene/` | the Lucene trial — the corpus, the wrappers that place the labels, and four instrumentation configurations to compare |
| `trial-netty/` | the Netty trial — the HTTP pipeline, the load generator, and the three-way A/B |
| `trial-jdbc/` | the PostgreSQL trial — a container driven by plain `docker run`, a HikariCP pool, and the CPU-time truth the thread-state column is held against |
| `sandbox/` | a place to *use* the tool rather than test it. Not a trial and not evidence: it is our code. The friction it turns up is in [sandbox.md](sandbox.md) |
| `trial-common/` | shared by every trial and depending on nothing but the JDK: the JFR recording and the collapsed-stack analysis |

## Running the four trials

Each is a separate Gradle module, so nothing a trial needs — Calcite, Lucene, Netty, a logging
binding — can reach the profiler, which depends on nothing but the Kotlin stdlib.

```bash
# the bench — the workload whose true answer is known
# `:run`, with the colon. Plain `run` matches the task in every module, so it runs the Calcite and
# Lucene trials too — with their own defaults, and with no argument you passed.
./gradlew :run --args="--seconds=20"
./gradlew :run --args="--seconds=20 --lock=2000,10"    # with injected blocking
./gradlew :run --args="--seconds=15 --threads=32 --oversubscribe"
./gradlew :run --args="--leakcheck"                    # the one fatal condition, staged on purpose

# Netty — qualification, the labelled run, and the A/B
./gradlew :trial-netty:classpathFile
CP=$(cat trial-netty/build/classpath.txt)
java -cp "$CP" com.ticksnick.trial.netty.NettyTrialKt --qualify --seconds=45
java -cp "$CP" com.ticksnick.trial.netty.NettyTrialKt --labels  --seconds=45
java -cp "$CP" com.ticksnick.trial.netty.NettyTrialKt --ab --rounds=8 --seconds=5

# Calcite — the growth curve, then the labelled run
./gradlew :trial-calcite:classpathFile
CP=$(cat trial-calcite/build/classpath.txt)
java -cp "$CP" com.ticksnick.trial.calcite.CalciteTrialKt --scale --from 3 --to 12 --associate true
java -Xmx6g -cp "$CP" com.ticksnick.trial.calcite.CalciteTrialKt \n     --tables 4 --associate true --warmups 1 --seconds 60 --labels true --sampler true

# Lucene — the index is already built under trial-lucene/index
./gradlew :trial-lucene:classpathFile
java -cp "$(cat trial-lucene/build/classpath.txt)" \
     com.ticksnick.trial.lucene.LuceneTrialKt --placement LABEL --seconds 45
```

**Runs on this laptop are not repeatable to better than about 60%.** Throughput falls 2.2× between
a two-second run and a forty-second one, and an A/B that rebuilds anything between arms is dominated
by the rebuilding rather than by the effect — see
[findings.md](findings.md#measurement-technique). Any comparison has to be interleaved, ABBA, and
against something that does not get torn down.
