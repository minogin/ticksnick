# Plan

What we are building, in order, and where each phase stands. Kept current — when a phase closes,
its section is rewritten to say what was actually built rather than what was intended.

Findings, techniques and dead ends live in [findings.md](findings.md). The idea and the prior art
live in [profiler.md](profiler.md). The trial on Apache Calcite has its own record in
[trial-calcite.md](trial-calcite.md). Where the existing tools fall short — the running case for building this at
all — is [case.md](case.md), and what we might do but have not committed to is [ideas.md](ideas.md).
What each document is for is [index.md](index.md); the short version of the whole thing, in plain
words, is [tldr.md](tldr.md).

| phase | subject | status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The bench — a workload whose true answer is known | **done** |
| 2 | The fine tier — slots, hook, sampling thread | **done** |
| 3 | Verification — sampler against the truth | **done** |
| — | Trial — the fine tier on somebody else's code | **done** |
| 3.5 | What a share is worth — bounding the error, not classifying operations | **done** |
| 3.75 | Placement — enter/exit, the balance check, report polish | **done** |
| — | Trial 2 — Lucene: concurrent, and identity by instance rather than by class | **done** |
| — | Trial 3 — Netty: few event loops, many tasks, time that is mostly not CPU | **done** |
| — | The coarse tier on all three trials — Calcite, Netty, Lucene | **done** |
| — | **Trial 4 — PostgreSQL over a socket: the first workload here with waiting in it** | **done — found a defect** |
| — | Trials 5+ — a compiler, two negative controls | later |
| 4 | The coarse tier — contexts, spans, cross-tabulation | **done** |
| 5 | Crossing threads — propagation, and per-operation parallelism | **done**; the coroutines module dropped, [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 25 |
| 6 | Thread state and the whole-application parallelism coefficient | **partly done**; what remains is designed and measured, not started |
| 7 | Library surface — annotations, agent, results API | **v0.1.0 released**; annotations and the agent not started |
| 8 | JFR output | not started |

**What this is for.** A general-purpose tool, released open source, for auditing the performance of
applications with hot short operations. Not tied to any one system — the graph-flavoured operation
names in the bench are a synthetic workload, nothing more.

Stack: Kotlin/JVM, Gradle, nothing beyond the Kotlin stdlib. Output to the console for now; see phase 8.

## What happens next, in order

> **This section is history.** It was written when the coarse tier was the next thing to build; the
> coarse tier, all of phase 5 and a fourth trial have happened since. For where the project actually
> stands, read the table above and the phase sections below. It is kept because step 2 was a pause

**Steps 1 and 2 are done, and so is what came after them.** What remains here is step 3, the coarse
tier. The record of the first two is kept below rather than deleted, because step 2 was a pause
written on the argument that *"nothing is expected to break is exactly when this project has been
wrong before"* — and it caught the new error bound being sound and vacuous on a thread pool. A
pause that earns its place deserves to stay in the record.

Since then, and not in the original plan: a test suite whose expectations are the measurements in
[findings.md](findings.md), two code reviews across every file, `D₂` fixed, and **v0.1.0 released**.
What the reviews turned up is in findings.md; the short version is that four real defects were
sitting in shipped code, one of which printed a negative percentage.

The three fixes were not tidying: each was a number in the report that was **wrong or misleading**,
and each was backed by measurement rather than by argument. Together they were the accumulated
interest on three trials.

### Step 1 — the three small things

**1a. The floor check stops being fatal.** **done.** [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 12.

*What was built.* Smaller than it looked: `Report.tooSmall()` already listed every below-floor label
at the end of every report, so the once-a-second `floorCheck` existed **only** to stop the run. It
is gone, with `nextFloorCheck` and `FLOOR_CHECK_NANOS`; the list stays and now names every offender
instead of the first one found.

That left `strict` gating nothing and `failure` with no producer, so `strict` was repointed at the
condition the ladder above always said was fatal and the code never implemented: a leaked label.
`Profiler.expectBalanced()` now calls `Sampler.fail()` under strict, naming the operation that was
open and the thread it was open on. The bench's own `--strict` no longer tests anything — the bench
never leaks — so `--leakcheck` stages a leak on purpose and asserts **both** directions: that it
stops under strict, and that it stops *only* under strict. A check that asserted the first alone
would still pass if the flag were wired to nothing.

*Verified.* `--leakcheck` passes both rounds. The bench at one thread names four operations and
finishes; at eight threads it names none, because eight busy threads make every operation on this
laptop 2.7× slower than its single-threaded fit and a 20 ns label reads 55 ns. Same binary, same
machine, half an hour apart — which is a sharper disproof of the "deterministic" premise than the
run-length one that started this, and it is recorded in
[findings.md](findings.md#the-machine). The bench had no surface for the warning at all
(it builds a `Report` and then prints its own tables, never `render()`), so it prints the list now.

A label below the 50 ns floor halts the session under `strict`. It has now stopped a *correct* run in
**two consecutive trials**: Lucene, citing 27.5 ns for a label whose settled figure is 49.7 ns, purely
because this laptop's throughput falls 2.2× with run length; and Netty, flagging `route` at 41 ns —
which is genuinely below the floor and is a label any reasonable person would place on a scan of
eight short strings.

By the [accuracy principle](profiler.md#how-accurate-this-has-to-be-and-where-that-budget-goes) a
below-floor label cannot move a ranking, so the cost of being wrong about it is the loudest failure
the tool has — stopping a run that was fine. **Downgrade to a warning, keep the message unchanged.**
The estimator work in item 12 becomes optional rather than blocking.

*Not affected:* the balance check stays fatal. A leaked label invents attribution, which is a
different category from a label being small.

*Check it with:* the bench, where four of twenty operations sit below the floor on purpose — it must
warn on all four and finish. And `trial-netty --labels`, which must stop needing `strict = false`.

**1b. The duty cycle per thread.** **done.** [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 10.

*What was built.* `DutyCycle` keeps its two sums per slot index as well as in aggregate; the sampler
keeps `slotHits` and `slotLabelled` beside them, two increments on the sampling thread and nothing
on the hot path. `DutyReport.shareDuty` is what every judgement about a *share* now divides by,
while `machineFloor` and `offCpuSamples` keep the aggregate, because there the whole process is the
subject and an idle thread belongs in it.

*The verify-first question was already answered, in [findings.md](findings.md#thread-state-beside-the-label):*
a thread inside a label is **not** always runnable — 52,422 of `lockedUpdate`'s 71,839 hits catch one
parked. So the cheap version was unavailable and this had to be the `Σ min(stall, labelled)` bound.

*Verified* on three bench modes, in [findings.md](findings.md#the-duty-cycle): ordinary agrees to
0.01 pp (nothing moved), starvation falls from 81.2 pp to 3.16, and the contended lock correctly
stays at 55.08 pp rather than collapsing. The predicted "under 1 pp" for starvation was wrong
arithmetic on our own recorded 96%; 3.16 pp is the right answer.

*Coverage:* both sides restricted to runnable occupancy, not just the unlabelled side — a label held
across a wait would otherwise reintroduce the same mismatch pointing the other way.

Two lines of every report divide by the wrong thing today.

The bound — *"at most 81.2 pp of any share is occupancy that was not CPU"* — is computed over **every
registered thread**, while the shares it bounds are over **labelled samples only**. An idle pool
thread therefore poisons a warning that is not about it. Measured in starvation mode: 18.83% duty and
a formally unbounded error, while the three working threads were on CPU 96% of the time and their
shares were fine.

The fix needs both halves per thread: thread *i*'s stall fraction, which the duty walk already
computes and discards, and thread *i*'s labelled fraction, which is a per-slot counter the sampler
writes. The stall that could possibly be inside labelled work is then `Σ min(stall_i, labelled_i)`.

The same counter fixes the **coverage** line, which has the same defect from the other direction: on
Lucene, 79.2% of unlabelled observations were a thread that was not runnable, so coverage against
*runnable* occupancy is ~83% rather than the 49.8% printed.

*Needs:* the immutable slot index, which already exists.

*Check it with:* starvation mode (`--active=3 --threads=16`), where the bound must fall from ~81 pp
to under 1 pp, and the ordinary bench, where nothing should change.

*Verify first, because it decides the shape:* that a thread inside a label is always runnable. The
bench's `--lock` mode is where to check — the label there sits *outside* the acquisition precisely so
that a parked thread is still inside the operation, which is the counter-example if there is one.

**1c. The report stops presenting CPU as the truth.** **done.** [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 17.

*What was built.* *"at most N pp of any share is occupancy that was not CPU"* became *"…is a thread
waiting rather than working"*, and the verdict for a low duty cycle stopped being an apology —
*"read a share as where threads SIT, not where cycles GO, and beware of adding two of them up, since
one wait can be counted once per thread waiting on it"*. That is the thing the duty cycle actually
guards against, and it is the reason it exists: occupancy counts a wait in full, which is what the
latency question wants, and a *sum* over threads is only additive when it is CPU.

*"share is of labelled samples and is occupancy, not CPU"* reads as an apology, and it is backwards
for most of what anyone profiles. Occupancy counts waiting in full, which is the right behaviour for
the latency question. The duty cycle exists not because CPU is the goal but because **summed
occupancy is only additive when it is CPU** — a hundred threads parked one second on one lock is a
hundred thread-seconds of occupancy and one second of real cost.

So the line should say what it guards against — *this total may be counting the same wait many
times* — rather than implying a CPU measurement was the objective and was missed. Same two sentences
of output as 1b, so do them together.

*Check it with:* reading it. No measurement involved; this one is wording.

### Step 2 — a look at what those three turn up · **done, and it turned something up**

Deliberately a pause rather than a phase. 1b in particular changes two numbers in every report, and
the trials' recorded figures were computed against the old denominators. Nothing was expected to
break, and "nothing is expected to break" is exactly when this project has been wrong before — which
is what happened.

**The bound as specified was vacuous on a thread pool.** `min(stall, labelled)` is sound, and on
Lucene it turned a true ~98% into a printed **47.35%** and a 100 pp error on shares that were fine.
A pool thread parks between tasks and works inside a label, so both terms are large and the formula
assumes the parking happened inside the label. Every bench mode passed because no bench thread has
both visible waiting and labelled time on it; only a pool does. The fix uses the state column, which
was already in the report saying **0.0% waiting** on every labelled operation — see
[findings.md](findings.md#the-duty-cycle). Bound on Lucene: **1.57 pp**.

**And there is a regime where nothing can be said, which the report now says out loud.** Netty's
event loops sit in `epoll_wait`, which is off the CPU and reads `RUNNABLE`, so **0.0 ms** of their
154.98 s of unlabelled time is visible as waiting. With 34.4% invisible off-CPU against labels
covering 13.9% of those threads, the worst case swallows every labelled sample. Printing 0.00% and
100 pp there would read as a measurement; the report explains instead, and names the fix — a label
around the waiting, not only around the work.

**What each trial said**, all four against the final code:

| trial | shape | result |
|---|---|---|
| Calcite | one thread, 100% labelled | 94.64% aggregate = 94.64% labelled, by construction |
| Lucene | pool threads that park between queries | 98.46%, bound 1.57 pp; coverage 59.3% → **84.5%** |
| Netty | event loops, native waiting | correctly declares itself unbounded, and says why |
| bench ×3 | see findings.md | unchanged, and provably so — the refinement is a no-op where `w = 0` |

**Also done here:** `trial-netty` no longer passes `strict = false`. That was there for the floor
check, and 1a removed the reason; its labels are lexical `op(id) { }` and cannot leak. It runs strict
now and finishes. Calcite was already strict, which makes it the one trial exercising the new fatal
rung on foreign code — its span stack came back balanced after every plan.

### Step 3 — phase 4, the coarse tier

Unless step 2 turns something up. The argument for going here rather than to a fourth trial:

- **It is the missing half.** The tool measures thread-time and cannot say how long one request
  took. [profiler.md](profiler.md) lists *"answer where exactly should we look, and why"* as
  requirement 3 and the gap is recorded there as deliberate.
- **The trials have converged.** Calcite taught the tool `enter`/`exit`; Lucene taught that
  misplacement is the danger and that the lexical form was back; Netty needed nothing new and its
  friction list is mostly *"the host decides"*. A fourth returns less than the third did.
- **Phase 5 needs it**, and phase 5 is what the supply-chain traversal this project came from
  actually requires — nanosecond operations crossing coroutine suspensions.

**The first task is bench work, not tool work:** promote some bench operations to coarse, so there is
a known truth to cross-tabulate against. Same discipline as every phase here — build the truth
before the instrument.

### Not in this plan, and why

- **Trials 4+** — the compiler and the two negative controls. Still worth doing, and now for the
  write-up rather than for the build. Kept in the table above.
- ~~**The virtual-thread registry**~~ — **done**, and the reason it stopped being deferrable is the
  reason it was deferred. It was put off because *"it bites no workload we can currently point at —
  neither trial creates virtual threads"*, which is a statement about our trials and not about the
  defect: "threads, **virtual threads**, and coroutines" is requirement 2 in
  [profiler.md](profiler.md), so the workload that hits it is one the tool is *for*. The registry is
  a fixed array indexed by slot index now — registration and release are a single store, and the
  walk is bounded by peak simultaneous threads rather than by how many the process ever made. See
  [findings.md](findings.md#the-sampler).
- **The on-demand stack sampler** ([ideas.md](ideas.md) item 14). Affordable and proven to work; four
  design questions unanswered. Diagnostics rather than correctness.


## Architecture — two tiers

The tool measures two different kinds of thing, and they cannot share a mechanism.

**Fine — physical operations.** A hash probe, an edge scan, one filter condition. Billions of
executions, atomic in the sense that they call nothing interesting. Identified by an integer in a
thread-local slot and measured by sampling. No identity, no allocation, no timestamps.

**Coarse — logical operations.** Expanding a frontier, applying a filter set, serving a query.
Thousands of executions rather than billions, freely crossing thread boundaries. Each execution gets
a real context object: allocated, propagated across hand-offs, timestamped at both ends.

**Where the boundary is, and it is not a size range.** It comes from what the instrumentation costs
per execution — ~40 ns for coarse against ~2 ns for fine — and it lands at **d ≥ max(800 ns, 4 µs ×
share)**, so in practice: *an operation under ~1 µs cannot be coarse, and that is the fine tier's
entire reason to exist.* Neither tier has an upper limit — Calcite's rule labels were hundreds of
microseconds and the fine tier measured them correctly. The derivation, the two conditions it comes
from, the exclusions that are not about size, and what the rule cannot bound are all in
[profiler.md](profiler.md#where-the-boundary-is), which is where the tier definitions live.

**They meet at the slot**, which carries both the current fine operation id and a reference to the
current coarse context. Every sample records the pair, so the fine breakdown can be cross-tabulated
against the logical operation it happened under:

> *Of the 400 ms of CPU under "apply filters", 180 ms was `matchCondition`, and it ran at 3.7×
> parallelism.*

Neither tier answers that alone. Fine sampling says what is hot but not what it was for; coarse
spans say where the time went but not why.

**Why there is no per-thread stack.** An earlier design had inclusive time coming from a stack of
ids per thread, which brought torn reads, recursion handling, and the problem that a stack is far
harder to carry across a coroutine suspension than a single value. The two tiers dissolve all of
it: inclusive time is wanted precisely for the operations that become coarse, and those carry an
explicit context that works across threads, which a per-thread stack never could. Fine operations
are atomic, so their self time *is* their inclusive time.

---

## Phase 1 — the bench · done

Twenty operations with self durations from 20 ns to 2 µs — two orders of magnitude — arranged in a
DAG four levels deep, driven by a shuffled fixed-seed schedule across N worker threads.

The shuffle is load-bearing, not cosmetic. It spreads every operation uniformly across the run, so
anything that drifts — clock, temperature, core migration — affects all operations in proportion
and cancels when shares are taken. Nearly every correctness argument in this project reduces to
that one property.

**Two truths, cross-checked.** Both multiply call counts by a duration; they differ only in where
the duration comes from.

- **A — configuration.** The duration we asked for.
- **B — batch measurement.** The duration measured afterwards on the worker threads, summed per
  thread so that each thread's calls meet its own measured durations.

Call counts are exact: counters sit on root calls only and everything nested is derived through
the call graph. If A and B disagree the bench is broken and the run stops — that check caught the
JIT collapsing the busy loop, which A alone could never have noticed.

**Also in:** iteration counts fitted by measuring at each operation's own working point; a warm-up
that checks only whether throughput has stopped *climbing*; the clock probed per phase including
during the run; `--sweep` across thread counts; starvation mode; and every tolerance derived from
measurement with the measurement recorded beside it.

**What it does not do:** the workload is uniform across threads and constant in time, and no
operation ever hands work to another thread. Phases 5 and 6 both need more than that.

## Phase 2 — the fine tier · done

A padded slot per thread holding the id of the operation that thread is inside. Entry writes the
id, exit restores the previous value — restores, not clears, or nesting collapses. A separate
thread wakes on a jittered interval, reads every slot, and increments a counter per id.

**Decisions that turned out to matter:**

- **Opaque access, not volatile.** A volatile store on x86 needs a StoreLoad barrier and the hook
  does two per call — that was 16% of throughput. Opaque emits no fence and stops the JIT
  eliminating the access.
- **The sampler spins.** Parking cannot hold a 1 ms step under load; it degraded to 13.5 ms and
  bunched its samples. Spinning costs a core, so with the sampler on the workers can never have
  every core, and a genuinely saturated machine is only measurable uninstrumented.
- **Counters on the slot.** The hook already holds the per-thread data, so counting is nearly
  free — and a share alone cannot distinguish 200M calls at 8 ns from 1000 at 1.6 ms.
- **Slots are released when a thread dies**, or dead threads read as idle ones forever.
- **`--labels` and `--sampler` are separate switches**, because the hook's cost and the sampler
  thread's cost are different questions.

## Phase 3 — verification · done

All three hypotheses from the original design hold, **for the fine tier**.

**1. The method works on operations four orders shorter than a tick.** At 476k samples the top 10
of 20 operations are ranked in the same order as an independently computed truth, and the largest
consumers are the most accurate — `popFrontier` within 0.25% of itself, `filterNode` within 0.00%.

The metric is the point. Divergence in percentage points shrinks as `1/√N` whether the method works
or not. Dividing each gap by its own standard error separates the two: unbiased and the RMS stays
near 1 at every sample count, biased and it grows with N. Across a 20× range of samples it grew
5.8× against 4.5× for pure bias, so the residual is systematic.

Worst miss is `tinyStep`, 15% of itself: a 20 ns operation holding 3.2% of the time. Errors
concentrate on the shortest operations and on parents, which absorb their children's hook entry
cost. The mechanism is only partly understood — see findings.

**2. The observer does not disturb the observed.** The hook is 1.7–2.3 ns per call, about 2% of a
call-weighted mean operation of 88 ns. Measured directly; the throughput comparison between
configurations is printed but marked inconclusive, because the machine drifts by more than the
effect.

**3. Unsynchronised slot reads do not smear the picture.** Follows from 1 holding.

## Trial — the fine tier on somebody else's code · done

Pointed at **Apache Calcite 1.42.0** query planning. Full record with every number in
[trial-calcite.md](trial-calcite.md); the harness is [`trial-calcite/`](../trial-calcite). What it settled:

**The candidate qualified.** A four-table chain join with join associate enabled takes 16–20 s to
plan, against 184 ms for three tables. JFR's flame graph is over 60% JDK collections and string
building, its inclusive view is one recursive spine where a dozen frames all read 80–99%, and the
frame carrying half the time — `ConverterRule.onMatch` at 49.14% — is not a rule at all but the
method twenty distinct enumerable rules inherit. The identity the domain cares about was not the
identity the stack had.

**The tool answered.** Labels on the rule *instance*, placed through Calcite's `RelOptListener`,
split that 49.14% almost entirely onto one rule: `EnumerableMergeJoinRule`, 46.18%. Removing it
takes planning from **17.8 s to 64.7 ms — 275× — for a plan 0.0026% worse by the planner's own
cost model.** That is the finding, and it is actionable.

**The sampler was validated against something we did not write.** Our shares and JFR's inclusive
shares agree within about a point on every rule in the slow configuration. Phase 3 proved the
sampler against our own bench; this is the first independent check, and it holds.

**Where they disagree, we learned something.** On a second configuration the two differ by 12 pp on
one rule, eleven times its noise floor, in a single shared run. Part is JFR stack truncation at 64
frames — measured, and raising the limit moved the number the predicted way. A label in a slot has
no depth, so that class of error cannot reach it. The remainder is unexplained and is an open
question. Separately: JFR delivered 6.3 ms and 13.7 ms when asked for 1 ms, where ours held 1.02 ms
and said so.

**What it cost:** nothing measurable. The labels sit on boundaries costing hundreds of
microseconds, so a 2 ns hook is parts per million. Both A/B comparisons came out with the wrong
sign, which is this machine's way of saying "below the floor".

**The friction, which is what phase 4 has to answer** — all nine items are in
[trial-calcite.md](trial-calcite.md#6-the-friction--what-the-trial-says-about-the-tool). The four that change the
design:

- **There is no enter/exit hook.** `op(id) { }` is a block, and almost nothing in third-party code
  is ours to wrap in a block. The trial wrote its own fifteen-line helper against `Profiler.slot()`.
  `Profiler.enter(id)` / `Profiler.exit()` and the stack they imply belong in the library, and the
  coarse tier needs exactly the same thing.
- **Non-lexical placement leaks silently and in the contaminating direction.** Calcite's "after"
  notification is not in a `finally`; a rule that throws leaves the label set and every later sample
  is billed to it. The trial added its own balance check. The library should provide one.
- **The report needs a counterfactual warning.** A 46% share became a 275× speedup, because the
  rule inflated everyone else's work as well as its own. Shares say where time went, not what
  removing something would do, and nothing in the output says so.
- **Call counts were the most valuable column.** They separate "1.5 ms per firing, 5,034 firings"
  from "9 µs per firing, 245,190 firings" — opposite problems with opposite fixes, and no stack
  profiler has counts at all.

**And the coarse tier's shape came out of it.** One plan is a coarse operation. Per-plan duration
varied 20–110 ms for byte-identical work, which nothing in the current output explains and which
per-instance spans with percentiles exist for. The sentence the trial wanted to write and could
not: *of the 48 ms median plan, 40% is `FilterIntoJoinRule`*.

## Phase 3.5 — what a share is worth · done

The fine tier is marked done, and it reports shares of **occupancy** — how many threads were inside
an operation — while presenting them as time. Three things stand between those two quantities and
none of them has been checked: an operation may block, threads may outnumber cores, and an
operation may not be the size its label claims.

**All three are now measured.** Every share carries a bound on how far occupancy can be from CPU;
an operation that cannot have been measured correctly stops the run within a second and says why;
one that is merely in the wrong tier gets told which kind of wrong it is. What is left open is the
value of the thresholds, which are provisional and gathered in one place — and the fact that
deciding *which* operation was waiting, rather than bounding how much waiting there was, needs the
thread's state sampled beside its label. That is phase 6.

**The decision that shapes this phase: bound the error, do not classify the operations.** The
tempting design is a rule for which operations are allowed to be fine — *on the grounds of whether
they block*. That rule cannot be written, and it should not be confused with the tier boundary in
[profiler.md](profiler.md#where-the-boundary-is), which is a different rule about a different
quantity: that one is decided by what the instrumentation costs, which is known in advance, while
this one would be decided by what the run does, which is not.
Nothing is guaranteed non-blocking — any allocation can meet a GC pause, any access can page-fault,
any thread can be descheduled between two instructions — so "could this block?" marks everything
coarse and answers nothing. Worse, contention is a property of the *run* and not of the code: a
`StampedLock` optimistic read is a 15 ns fine operation in a read-mostly phase and a parked thread
in a write-heavy one, from identical source. What can be measured is *how much* of the occupancy
was not CPU, and that single number bounds the error on every share at once, whatever caused it.

This is the same discipline as the noise floor already in the report — that says how wrong chance
could make a share; this says how wrong blocking could make it.

### 1. The CPU duty cycle, and the bound it implies · **done**

`ThreadMXBean.getThreadCpuTime(id)` per registered thread, sampled at a **low** rate — once a
second, or every *n* ticks — never per tick. The ratio of summed CPU delta to summed wall delta
across live threads is the duty cycle.

**Built.** [`Duty.kt`](../src/main/kotlin/com/ticksnick/Duty.kt): `ThreadCpuClock` checks
support, enables the clock, and *measures* its resolution; `DutyCycle` rides the sampler's tick loop
at a one-second window; `DutyReport` renders the line and the bound. It is in both reports — the
bench's and the library's `Report.render()`, which is where it matters, since it is the thing that
tells a user of the tool what their shares are worth.

**And what it found, which was not what this section expected.** The null test — the ordinary bench,
which allocates nothing and blocks on nothing — read **78%**, not ~100%. The implementation is
right: on this machine eight workers and a spinning sampler on 16 logical cores lose 14–18% of
their wall time to the scheduler, in preemptions of milliseconds. *Never blocks is a property of
the code; being on a CPU is not.* The full numbers are in [findings.md](findings.md#the-duty-cycle).

So the ground truth for the null test could not come from the configuration, and it now comes from
a second measurement: the workers' own account of their preemptions, taken from gaps in the clock
readings the run loop already makes to check its deadline. Two mechanisms with nothing in common,
agreeing to 0.06–0.54 pp across five configurations. That is a far stronger check than matching a
number we had assumed, and it is phase 1's two-truths discipline arriving where it was needed.

The report line, beside the achieved sampling rate:

> *threads were on CPU 96.4% of sampled wall time — at most 3.6 pp of any share is occupancy that
> was not CPU*

**Why it is an upper bound.** The non-CPU fraction is all the stalling there was, from every cause
together. Even if all of it landed on one operation, no share can move by more than that fraction.
Worked: an operation at a 50% occupancy share, with threads 97% on CPU and *every* stall belonging
to that operation, has a true CPU share of `(0.50 − 0.03) / 0.97` = 48.5% — so the reported figure
is within 1.5 pp no matter how the stalling was distributed. At 23% on CPU the same arithmetic
allows the operation to be almost entirely waiting. So at 96% the ranking is trustworthy; at 23%
the report is describing where threads *sit* rather than where cycles *go*, and it must say so
rather than let the reader assume otherwise.

**"Blocking" here means waiting for another thread — not waiting for memory.** A cache miss to DRAM
is ~100 ns during which the core is *occupied*: it is CPU time, it is real cost of the operation,
and the sampler already attributes it correctly. Nothing in this phase should try to detect or
subtract it. The same goes for an uncontended lock, which is a CAS and does not block. What this
phase is bounding is time when the thread was **not on a CPU at all**.

**It also retires the threads ≤ cores assumption** for free. The sampler reads slots, not cores, so
200 runnable threads on 16 cores over-read CPU by 12× — and that shows up as a duty cycle far below
100% without any special handling. It retired rather more than that: on this machine the scheduler
stops keeping runnable threads on cores long before the cores run out, at nine busy threads of
sixteen.

**Needs:** the owning thread's id on the slot, recorded at slot creation, off the hot path. Store
the id rather than a `Thread` reference so a dead thread is not pinned. Done — `OpSlot.threadId`.

**Platform caveat, measured and not assumed.** On Windows this comes from `GetThreadTimes`, updated
on scheduler ticks. Probed by spinning and watching the counter move, the step is **15.625 ms** —
1.6% of a one-second window, and the quantisation telescopes across windows, so the aggregate is
sound while a single window can read 100.29%. `isThreadCpuTimeSupported` and
`isThreadCpuTimeEnabled` are both checked and the clock enabled if it is off; where the resolution
cannot support the window the report says the number is unavailable rather than printing a bad one.

**What it costs.** Up to 214.7 µs per walk, once a second, on the sampling thread. The achieved
step stayed 1.001 ms with zero resyncs.

**The one weakness, and it is now measured.** The duty cycle covers every registered thread while
the shares cover labelled samples only, so a thread parked outside any operation lowers the bound
without appearing in what is being bounded. In starvation mode that is stark: 18.83% duty and a
formally unbounded error, while the three working threads were on CPU 96% of the time. The report
says so; tightening it needs the duty cycle per thread paired with that thread's labelling, which
wants the same slot index the long-instance detector wants — [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 10.

### 2. The long-instance detector · **built, thresholds not yet settled**

The sampler already reads the slot's operation id. Have it read **that operation's call counter**
in the same tick and keep the pair from the previous tick:

| across two ticks | id | counter | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| same | same | increased | many short instances — genuinely fine |
| same | same | **unchanged** | one instance spanning ≥ 1 tick |

A 20 ns operation has a 1-in-50,000 chance of being caught by a single sample, so an instance
surviving two consecutive ticks is not the operation its label describes. **Entry and exit are
untouched** — the counter increment already exists and the sampler reads one extra word.

Split the sampler's per-operation counter in two, *fresh* and *stuck*, so one pass yields both an
occupancy share and a running share, and the report can say per operation: *340 instances lasted
over a tick — this label is not the size it claims, and coarse is now affordable for it.* Not
*"this is not a fine operation"*, which is how this read before the
[tier boundary](profiler.md#where-the-boundary-is) was settled: the fine tier has no upper limit,
and a long label is measured perfectly well by it — Calcite's were, to within a point of JFR.
What being long changes is that coarse becomes **available**, offering per-execution statistics
that fine can never give.

**Where the previous tick's pair is kept matters.** Not on the `OpSlot`: the sampler writing to that
object would invalidate the owner's cache line on every tick, which is precisely the false sharing
the padding exists to prevent. Give `OpSlot` an immutable index assigned at construction and let the
sampler keep its own parallel arrays. Reading `counts[id]` already touches a second cache line per
slot per tick, so the sampler's own cost roughly doubles — irrelevant, it has a core.

**What the sampler's read of `counts[id]` costs the owner, since it is the obvious worry.** The
owning thread writes that counter on every call, so the sampler pulling the line into shared state
forces one coherence round trip on the owner's next write. That is once per slot per tick against
millions of increments in the same millisecond — of the order of one increment in a million pays
for it. Expected to be unmeasurable, and it should be *measured* rather than assumed, in the
manner of everything else here: `--labels` and `--sampler` are already separate switches, which is
exactly the comparison this needs.

**Limits, which belong in the output as much as the finding does.** The floor is one tick: a 50 µs
lock stall can never span two ticks and is invisible. And *stuck* conflates blocked, descheduled,
and legitimately-long-but-running — separating those needs the thread's state, and only for slots
the counter test already flagged, which is normally almost none.

**What it came to.** `OpSlot` carries an immutable index, recycled when a thread dies; the sampler
keeps `prevOp`/`prevCount`/`prevStuck` arrays of its own and reads the counter opaquely, so the
owner's hot path is untouched. Verified in both regimes: on a quiet machine the run-wide rate of
executions outliving a tick is 0.04% and nothing is flagged; at 15 threads on 16 cores it is 15.52%
and *still* nothing is flagged, because preemption raises every operation together — 13.27% to
17.90% across all twenty, worst 1.15× the run-wide rate. That uniformity is what makes "excess over
the run-wide rate" a valid test, and it is now measured rather than argued.

It is also a third independent view of the stalling the duty cycle bounds: 18.04% non-CPU, 17.11%
by the workers' own gaps, 15.52% by the detector, in the predicted order since the detector's floor
is a whole tick. Full numbers in [findings.md](findings.md#the-long-instance-detector).

**What is not settled: the thresholds.** Naming an operation takes three conditions together — a
rate well above the run-wide one, a floor under the rate itself, and enough long executions that
one GC pause cannot be the whole story. All three are provisional, in one place
(`Report.SUSPECT_*`), and the experiments that settle them are below. The third condition was not
in the original design and was added the first time this ran: on a quiet machine the run-wide rate
is 0.04%, so a single long execution made `serialize` 3.85× the baseline and the check accused it.

### 3. Implied per-call duration · **built**

`hits × step / calls`, which is already derivable and was the most valuable column in the Calcite
trial. It is the smell test the person who wrote the code can apply and the tool cannot: an
operation known to be 20 ns showing 500 ns implied is stalling on something. It inherits the same
bound as everything else, and the column heading says occupancy rather than time.

Verified against the bench, whose true answer is known, over a hundredfold range of durations: it
reproduces each operation's configured duration times the load factor, and where it falls short it
reproduces the *known* attribution bias rather than a new one — `tinyStep` at −14% against phase 3's
−15.5% for the same operation. In the API demo it is exact: 120 busy-loop iterations at 0.83 ns
read back as 102.0 ns.

### What the tool does about it — the severity ladder

Three severities, and one question decides which a finding gets: **can the condition be attributed
to the code, or only to the run?**

| severity | when | what happens |
|---|---|---|
| **fatal** | the label is provably not measuring what it claims, and the condition is a property of the code rather than of the machine | sampling stops, the report is marked invalid and leads with the failure, the operation and the fix are named |
| **warning** | the measurement is honest but the label is in the wrong tier, or the run's conditions limit what the numbers mean | printed with the report, which stays valid |
| **note** | what the reader needs in order to read the numbers — the bound, the noise floor, what was excluded | printed |

**One rung is fatal, and it is not the one this ladder was written for.** A *leaked* label stops the
session. Too small and too long are both warnings:

- *A leak invents attribution.* A label left open at a point the caller declared quiescent bills
  every subsequent sample on that thread to the wrong operation, and the result does not look like
  an error — it looks like a finding, with a plausible number beside it. Nothing downstream detects
  it and no rerun makes it valid. Checked in both directions by `--leakcheck`, which stages one on
  purpose: a check that never fires is not a check.
- *Too small* was fatal, on the argument that a 20 ns operation is 20 ns on a loaded machine, a
  quiet one, a different machine and every rerun. Lucene falsified the premise — this laptop's
  throughput alone moves the estimate 2.2× — and the
  [accuracy principle](profiler.md#how-accurate-this-has-to-be-and-where-that-budget-goes) finished
  it: a below-floor label is one row of a list and cannot move a ranking, so the cost of being wrong
  about one is the loudest failure this tool has. It stopped a *correct* run in two consecutive
  trials. Now a warning, with the advice unchanged and every offender named rather than only the
  first.
- *Too long* depends on the run. Contention is a property of the workload that day; a `StampedLock`
  optimistic read is a 15 ns fine operation in a read-mostly phase and a parked thread in a
  write-heavy one, from identical source. Worse, Calcite proved that an operation can outlive a tick
  and still be measured perfectly: those rule labels are coarse-sized, and their shares agreed with
  JFR to about a percentage point and became the 275× finding. Aborting on that signal would have
  destroyed the most valuable result this project has produced.

**Fatal never means killing the host.** This is a library inside somebody else's process. Fatal
means the profiling session stops and says why; the application carries on. Our own bench may
exit(1) on it, because the bench *is* the application.

**And it is switchable, because of Calcite.** `strict = false` downgrades fatal to warning, for the
case where the labels are on code you do not own and cannot fix. The leak is then still counted and
still printed — switching strict off buys a report, not silence.

### Catching an operation that is below the floor

The implied duration already says it when the operation gets hits. What makes this a *check* rather
than a column is that it also works when the operation is never sampled at all, which is the case
that looks like a blind spot and is in fact the strongest evidence available.

Seeing zero hits in *n* samples bounds the true rate at under `3/n` with 95% confidence — the rule
of three — and the arithmetic then collapses: an operation's total occupancy is under **three ticks**
however many samples were taken, so its cost per call is under `3 × tick / calls`. Forty million
calls at a 1 ms tick puts it under 0.075 ns, a fraction of one cycle.

One formula covers both cases. Take the upper confidence bound on the hit count —
`hits + 2√hits + 3`, which is just 3 when hits is zero — and if even *that* implies a duration below
the floor, the operation is too small, whatever the sampler did or did not catch.

Two adjustments keep it from accusing the innocent: the sampler reads operations below 45 ns some
5–9% low, which is systematic and in the wrong direction here, so the bound is inflated by 20%
before comparing; and everything else is left to the bound's own conservatism. `edgeScan` at 45 ns
is genuinely under the floor and is deliberately not named, because being sure matters more than
being complete.

**The call counts have to be this session's.** The first version divided session hits by the
registry's process-lifetime totals, which include threads that died before sampling began — the
bench's warm-up is exactly that — and every implied duration came out about a third low. It was
caught because the check is a *bound*: it accused a 20 ns operation of being under 7.9 ns, and an
upper bound below the truth is impossible. An estimate that came out 60% low would have been
believed. The sampler now snapshots the counts before its first tick.

**What cannot be caught, and it belongs in the message rather than in a document.** C2 unrolling
adjacent short loops and shuffling work across the label boundaries is undetectable — the demo lost
95% of one operation and nothing in the data said so. That is a second, independent reason not to
put labels on tiny operations, and the only defence is the advice, which is why the advice is
printed rather than filed.

### What settles the thresholds, and in what order

Decided with the numbers rather than in advance, because the first thing the detector will do on
real code is fire on operations whose measurement is perfectly honest.

1. ~~build the detector and the implied duration column, verify on the bench where nothing should
   fire~~ — **done**.
2. ~~Run it on the Calcite trial.~~ **Done, and it changed the design.** The controls held — rules
   under 10 µs per firing read 0.00%, rules over 100 µs read 39–75% — and GC turned out not to be
   the false-positive source it was feared to be: 119 pauses totalling 2.6% of wall time, against
   the duty cycle's independently measured 3.01% of occupancy that was not CPU.
   What failed was the decision rule. Judging each operation against the *run-wide* rate of long
   executions assumes long executions are the exception; in Calcite's planner that rate is 53.52%,
   because most of those labels genuinely are coarse. Nothing could ever be named. **The floor now
   comes from the duty cycle** — what the machine did to everything — which separates all three
   data sets we have. Full numbers in [findings.md](findings.md#the-detector-against-calcite).
3. ~~Add the contended bench operation~~ — **done**, `--lock`. The duty cycle tracked injected
   blocking from 0.4% to 64% of wall time and never missed the workers' own timing by more than
   1.15 pp; the detector named `lockedUpdate` alone; and the floor had to be rebuilt a third time,
   because a blocking operation is itself off the CPU and so was hiding behind the duty cycle.
4. ~~Then decide what the tool *does* about a flagged operation~~ — **done, and the answer is
   nothing fatal.** Calcite's rule labels are all flagged by this signal and their shares are
   correct; a run stopped over them would have destroyed the 275× finding. What the tool does
   instead is say *which kind* of long it is, where it can: the run's whole off-CPU budget bounds
   how much of an operation's long-running time could have been waiting, and on Calcite's slowest
   rule that leaves **at least 91% certainly on a core** — working, not waiting, share honest,
   label it coarse. Where the budget is big enough to explain the operation away, the verdict is
   *cannot say which* and it carries the size of the budget, which is the part a reader can act on:
   3.2% on Calcite against 35.2% on the contended bench. Resolving that properly needs the thread's
   state beside the label, which is phase 6.
   **Since resolved — phase 6's first half is built and the verdict no longer hedges.** It reads the
   operation's own long-and-waiting samples instead of the run's aggregate budget, so it now says
   *waiting* where it could only shrug before (`lockedUpdate`, 70.1% of its long samples parked,
   against the workers' own 73.4%) and *working* where the old test would still have hedged
   (Lucene's `clause:prefix`, 100.0% of its long samples runnable). The aggregate reasoning above
   survives only as the fallback when state sampling is switched off.

**Step 4 is deliberately last.** The Calcite labels sit on operations of hundreds of microseconds:
they are not fine operations by any definition here, and yet the shares they produced agreed with
JFR to about a percentage point and became the 275× finding. So the detector will flag them, and
aborting on that would have destroyed the single most valuable result this project has produced.
What distinguishes *honest but coarse-sized* from *corrupted* is not duration but whether the
thread was on CPU while it ran — which is the per-operation duty cycle, [ideas.md](ideas.md) item
10, and not something this signal can decide alone. Erring early is right; erring on this signal
alone is not.

### What this phase deliberately does not do

Classify operations as fine or coarse. Detect locks specifically. Attribute non-CPU time to a
particular operation — it bounds the error globally and does not apportion it. Nor does it touch the
coroutine or virtual-thread hazards, which are [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 8.

**Relationship to phase 6.** Phase 6 samples each thread's *state* alongside its label, and its
heuristic for telling executing from spinning from parked is exactly what would resolve the
ambiguity in *stuck* above — and would let non-CPU time be apportioned to an operation rather than
merely bounded. This phase is the cheap aggregate that can be had now, before there is anything
dispatcher-shaped in the bench to develop that heuristic against. The two are the same question at
two prices, and doing the cheap one first is what makes the expensive one checkable.

### Bench work, and it is the real work

The bench has never blocked and never oversubscribed — every thread runs the same schedule flat out
on at most one core each. Nothing here can be verified against it as it stands. Needed:

- ~~an operation that contends on a real lock, with the contention rate a parameter~~ — **done.**
  `--lock=<hold µs>,<interval ms>` gives `lockedUpdate`, which takes a real `ReentrantLock` and parks
  everyone else. It sits outside the operation catalogue and outside the two truths, so none of
  phase 1's machinery had to learn about an operation whose duration is not its configured one.
  The label goes *outside* the acquisition, so a parked thread is still inside the operation — which
  is the property being tested.
- ~~a mode with threads well above core count~~ — **done**, `--oversubscribe`. At 32 threads on 16
  cores the duty cycle reads 37.39% against the workers' own 37.71%.
- ~~the expected duty cycle computed from the configuration~~ — **done, and it had to be done
  differently.** The configuration cannot predict the duty cycle, because the operating system
  deschedules threads that have nothing to wait for. The second truth is instead the workers' own
  account of their preemptions, from the gaps in the clock readings the run loop already makes:
  `Worker.stallNanos`, no new bench machinery and nothing added to the hot loop.

**Done when** — all four hold, and the numbers are in
[findings.md](findings.md#against-injected-blocking):

- ~~duty cycle reads ~100% on the existing non-blocking bench~~ → the OS accounting and the workers'
  own account of the same quantity agree. **0.28–1.15 pp across six configurations.**
- an injected blocking operation moves it by the injected amount. **Tracked from 0.4% to 64% of
  wall time blocked, never off by more than 1.15 pp.**
- threads at 2× cores are reported as such. **37.39% at 32 threads on 16 cores, and the report says
  it is describing where threads sit rather than where cycles go.**
- the detector fires on the injected blocker and stays silent otherwise. **`lockedUpdate` named
  alone, at 20× and 200× the machine floor; nothing named in any non-blocking configuration.**

What is *not* settled is the thresholds, which remain provisional — and one limit is now measured
rather than asserted: with a mean wait of 342 µs, a third of a tick, the detector sees 36% of the
blocking that is really there. It still names the operation, because the tail of the distribution
crosses a tick often enough, but it cannot quantify it. Quantifying is the duty cycle's job. Neither
instrument is sufficient alone, which is the argument for having both.

## Phase 3.75 — placement: labels in code you do not own · done

Phase 7's essentials, pulled forward, because the Calcite trial could not use the documented API at
all and because the coarse tier needs the same machinery anyway. Everything here comes from the
[friction list](trial-calcite.md#6-the-friction--what-the-trial-says-about-the-tool) — observed, not
imagined.

**1. `Profiler.enter(id)` / `Profiler.exit()`, and the span stack they imply.** An *addition* to
`op(id) { }`, never a replacement. The block form stays the first thing anyone is shown: it is
inline, it costs nothing beyond the hook, and its `finally` is generated by the compiler so it
cannot leak. But `op(id) { }` is a block, and almost nothing in third-party code is ours to wrap in
a block — the boundary Calcite exposes is two callbacks, one before and one after. The trial wrote
its own fifteen lines against `Profiler.slot()`, which is public but was never presented as the way
to place a label. The two forms must nest in either order.

**2. A balance check, because a non-lexical label leaks silently and in the contaminating
direction.** Calcite's "after" notification is not inside a `finally`: a rule that throws leaves the
label set, and every later sample on that thread is billed to it. No error, no warning, a plausible
wrong number. The trial checked the span stack after every one of 484 iterations rather than
assuming it, and the library should offer that rather than making each user reinvent it.

By the severity ladder this is *fatal* — a leaked label is a property of the placement, not of the
run, and it invents attribution rather than losing it. What makes it early enough to be worth
failing on is the user calling `expectBalanced()` at a boundary they know is quiescent; what makes
it catchable at all is that depth is checked when the session stops.

**3. Fold operations with no samples, and say how many were folded.** Calcite's report carried
twenty-five rules at 0.000%, which is most of a screen of nothing.

**4. The counterfactual warning.** A 46% share became a 275× speedup, because that rule was creating
work for every other rule as well as doing its own. Shares say where time went, not what removing
something would save, and the report has never said so.

**5. `op(id, times = n)` for batch labels.** The floor work says an operation under ~50 ns should
not be labelled individually — label the enclosing loop and divide. Today that leaves the report
speaking in loop-executions; this makes it speak in the user's units.

**Not here:** annotations, the bytecode agent, published artifacts, a frozen public API. Those stay
in phase 7. Nothing in this phase needs to be public — it needs to be *placeable*.

**Done when:** a label can be placed on a before/after callback without the user writing a helper;
a leaked label is reported rather than silently believed; and the report reads cleanly on a
workload with forty labels of which fifteen ever fire. **All three hold.**

**What it came to.**

- `Profiler.enter(id)` / `exit()` / `depth()` / `expectBalanced()`, with a fixed 64-deep stack per
  thread. Only the non-lexical form touches it, so depth is exactly the number of labels placed by
  hand and not yet closed — a balance check rather than a call-depth counter. **The trial's fifteen
  lines are gone**: `RuleLabeller` now calls `Profiler.enter`/`exit`, the plan-boundary check is
  `Profiler.expectBalanced()`, and the Calcite numbers are unchanged (`EnumerableMergeJoinRule`
  46.08% against 46.18% before).
- The report counts leaks two ways: labels found open where the caller said the thread was
  quiescent, and threads still inside one when sampling stops. **Measured in the demo**: a leak
  every thousandth pass on one of four threads inflated that operation's share by 3.4 pp against a
  construction of 40.7%, while the operation next to it landed on 40.4%. The share does not look
  wrong. That is the whole problem with a leaked label, and now there is a number beside it.
- Zero-sample operations are folded with a count, and the ones that *ran* and were still never
  sampled are named — those are a finding, not clutter. On Calcite: *22 operations were never
  sampled and are folded away; 1 of them did run: rule:EnumerableLimitRule.*
- The counterfactual warning closes every report.
- `op(id, times = n)` reports in the caller's units for a label placed around a loop.

## Trial 2 — Lucene · done

The full record is [trial-lucene.md](trial-lucene.md); this is what it changed.

**It qualified for a cleaner reason than Calcite did.** Calcite's flame graph pointed the wrong way;
Lucene's does not point at all. Four `TermQuery` clauses on four different terms share every frame
they have, and a flame graph attributed three of eight clauses with 51.2% of samples naming no
clause at all. The labels separated all eight: prefix 48.49%, phrase 42.66%, and the four
same-class clauses spanning 2.080% down to 0.163%.

**Everything under test came through, and two things did not.**

Held: the lexical form came back (a wrapper body is a block we own, so `enter`/`exit` was never
needed — the opposite shape from Calcite, and the second data point that both forms are required);
the counts column separated 20.8 M calls at 2.2 µs from 495 M at 81 ns for two clauses holding
nearly the same share; the long-instance detector fired on the prefix clause and was right; the
concurrency was uneventful — eight worker threads, no imbalance, no leak, shares reproducing across
run lengths to within 0.4 points; and `strict` caught a genuinely bad placement in one second.

Did not hold:

1. **The floor check is not machine-independent.** It also stopped a *correct* placement, citing
   27.5 ns for a label whose settled figure is 49.7 ns. On this laptop, throughput falls 2.2× between
   a two-second run and a forty-second one, so implied per-call duration rises 3× with run length
   while every share stays put. The claim in `floorCheck`'s own documentation — "identical on every
   machine and every rerun" — is false here. Candidate fixes are in
   [findings.md](findings.md#open-questions); the cheapest is to require the estimate to be low in
   two consecutive windows rather than one.
2. **A misplaced label is invisible from inside the report.** Labelling the scorer but not the
   factory that builds it reported the decisive clause a third low, with every number plausible and
   nothing indicating a gap. Only an independent measurement found it. **Since fixed, in part** —
   see below.

### What the trial changed in the tool

**Absolute occupancy beside share, and coverage in thread-time.** `share` is a share of *labelled*
samples, which is the right denominator and a treacherous number to compare between runs: it
re-scales every row whenever the set of labels changes. Measured with the bad placement preserved as
a configuration and both run twice, the phrase clause appears to become fourteen points cheaper when
a *different* clause's label is fixed — while its occupancy does not move at all (38–41 s in every
run) and the clause actually fixed doubles. The column costs nothing: `hits × step`, already
collected and previously discarded.

That makes the *iterative* case self-diagnosing — move a label, diff the column. It does not solve
the cold start, where there is no earlier run to compare against; that needs bracketing by a coarse
label (which phase 4 gives for free, and this is a better argument for phase 4 than the one below)
or a low-rate stack sample on unlabelled ticks ([ideas.md](ideas.md) item 14). Numbers in
[findings.md](findings.md#placement).

**And the closest competitor was measured.** Elasticsearch's approach — wrap every scorer in
`System.nanoTime()` — ranks the wrong clause first on this workload, because the instrument charges
per call and the two top clauses differ 21× in call count. One free parameter reconciles all eight
clauses to an RMS of 0.09 pp. It is in [case.md](case.md), and it is the strongest single argument
for sampling this project has produced.

**What did not come up:** stack depth. Lucene's deepest sample was 44 frames with zero truncation,
so the argument that beat Calcite hardest was irrelevant here.

## Trials 3+ — the rest of the list · three done, and the fourth changed the list

Two data points now, and they disagreed usefully — Calcite said the tool needed a non-lexical form,
Lucene said the lexical one was back and that the danger had moved from *leaking* a label to
*misplacing* one. A third will do the same to whatever we believe after two.

**What makes a good target**, from what the trials actually taught us:

1. hot operations of tens of nanoseconds, executed billions of times;
2. **the domain's identity is not the stack's identity** — several logical operations behind one
   frame. This is the differentiator, and the only reason the Calcite result was interesting;
3. concurrent, so the duty cycle and the occupancy-against-CPU work is exercised on foreign code —
   Calcite planning is single-threaded and never tested any of it;
4. extension points that can be decorated without forking.

**Next: Netty**, then the compiler, then the two negative controls. Lucene is done and its record is
[trial-lucene.md](trial-lucene.md).

| candidate | why it is on the list | what it tests that the others do not |
|---|---|---|
| ~~**Lucene** search~~ · **done** | clauses share `Scorer` / `DocIdSetIterator` frames; concurrent across segments; built to be extended | placement by *wrapping*, and the first concurrent foreign workload — both delivered, plus the timed-wrapper comparison nobody planned |
| **Netty** pipeline | N handlers behind one `channelRead`; event-loop threads | a different concurrency shape entirely — few threads, many tasks, and time that is mostly *not* CPU |
| **javac or the Kotlin compiler** | many passes through the same visitor frames; the identity question is "which pass", which no stack answers | depth — compilers recurse hard, and JFR truncates at 64 frames where a slot has no depth at all |
| **JGraphT** or any graph library | closest to the shape this project came from: node expansion, edge scan, tens of nanoseconds | whether the tool says anything useful when methods *are* the operations |
| **Jackson** | hot, short, and its identity maps cleanly onto methods | the same, at the smallest operation size we have ever tried |

**The last two are negative controls and that is why they are worth doing.** A stack profiler
already answers "which method" well; if our labels merely reproduce what a flame graph says, the
tool should be seen to reproduce it rather than to invent a difference. [case.md](case.md) keeps an
honest section on where the other tools are better, and it is currently built from one workload.
A trial that ends in "async-profiler would have told you this in ten seconds" is a real result and
belongs there.

Each trial gets its own module beside [`trial-calcite/`](../trial-calcite), so nothing it depends on can reach the
profiler, which still takes nothing beyond the Kotlin stdlib.

### Running one — what the first two trials say to do, in order

[trial-calcite.md](trial-calcite.md) and [trial-lucene.md](trial-lucene.md) are the two full records. What they
establish about *how to run one*:

1. **Qualify the candidate before instrumenting it.** Calcite earned the trial by taking 16–20 s to
   plan a four-table join against 184 ms for three, and by having a flame graph that was over 60%
   JDK collections and string building. A workload nobody would want profiled proves nothing. For
   Lucene that means finding a query whose cost is real and whose *clause* costs are not obvious.
2. **Find the hook the library exposes, and label the whole lifecycle of what it names.** For
   Calcite it was `RelOptListener` and nothing else was reachable without forking; for Lucene it was
   the `Query → Weight → ScorerSupplier → Scorer → DocIdSetIterator` chain. Lucene added the rule
   that costs the most to learn: **label the factory as well as the product.** Labelling only the
   scorer, and not the supplier that built it, reported the decisive clause at 32.2% instead of
   48.5% — and the report looked entirely healthy either way.
3. **Do not let the wrapper change the workload.** New with Lucene, and Calcite could not have shown
   it. Base classes supply working defaults for bulk fast paths, so a wrapper that overrides only
   the obvious methods still returns the right answers about a workload the library would never have
   run: 13.3% slower, one clause's calls 40× higher, its rank moved from seventh to third. Every
   escape hatch has to be delegated, and the check that it worked is a flame graph over the inert
   wrapper against one over the bare code.
4. **Measure the mechanism separately from the hook.** Attaching *any* listener made Calcite
   allocate two objects per rule firing; wrapping cost Lucene 3.84% before a single label was
   placed, of a 6.54% total. The comparison has to be three-way — nothing, mechanism-with-no-op,
   mechanism-with-label — or our hook is charged for somebody else's cost. Interleave it and swap
   the order every round: this machine's clock moved 2.5× mid-comparison and all configurations
   moved together, which is the only reason the number survived.
5. **Check the labels against something independent, and take the disagreement seriously.** JFR
   agreed with Calcite's labels to about a percentage point. On Lucene it disagreed, and the
   disagreement was ours — item 2 above. Where the two disagree, that is the finding, and it is not
   automatically the other tool's fault.
6. **Keep the friction list as you go.** It is the deliverable that gets dropped when the finding
   goes well, and it is what phase 3.75 was built out of.

**What is under test after two trials.** Lucene exercised `enter`/`exit` by *not needing it*, the
duty cycle and its bound on foreign concurrent code, the long-execution detector, the floor check
under `strict`, folded empty operations, and the counts column. Still never met on foreign code:
`op(id, times = n)`, the balance check on a workload that actually throws, and anything at all above
the fine tier.

## Phase 4 — the coarse tier · **done**

Contexts, spans and the cross-tabulation, same-thread. Crossing threads is phase 5, and the two were
kept apart so that a propagation bug could never be confused with a tier bug.

**What is built.** A `CoarseContext` per execution — type id, parent, start timestamp — published
into the slot beside the fine id and read from the sampling thread with no lock and no fence, which
is safe for exactly one reason: every identity field is `val`, so the end of the constructor carries
a freeze. Contexts are **never recycled**; reuse would break that freeze and let the sampler credit a
sample to a context that had since become a different execution. Nesting is the parent chain, so
`exitCoarse` is one field write and no stack is needed. Aggregation is per type — fifty types is
bounded, fifty thousand executions is not — and each thread keeps its own span statistics, folded
together when the report is taken and into the retired totals when the thread goes.

`coarse(type) { }` is the form to reach for; `enterCoarse`/`exitCoarse` exists for the boundary that
is two callbacks, carries the same no-`finally` hazard `enter` does, and is now covered by
`expectBalanced` — which checks the coarse half **first**, because a leaked context collects a whole
request's samples where a leaked label collects one operation's.

**What comes out, per coarse type:**

| quantity | basis |
|---|---|
| executions, mean, min, max, p50/p90/p99 | **measured** — two timestamps per execution, the only unsampled numbers in the report |
| busy/exec | sampled, running samples only, so `mean − busy/exec` **is** the waiting |
| breakdown by fine operation | sampled, from the `(fine, coarse)` pair, credited inclusively |
| in flight | sampled, and printed over the thread count for the reason the fine column is |

Percentiles come from a 320-bucket log histogram, 2.5 KB per type per thread, allocated lazily so a
fine-tier-only program pays nothing. Forty lines rather than a dependency.

**The unsettled question is settled, and phase 6 settled it.** The old text here said the CPU column
would really be *occupancy*, so `span − CPU` would come out near zero and the report would say "no
waiting here" in exactly the case where it is all waiting — the one answer that was wanted,
inverted. That is no longer a risk: the sampler already reads thread state per slot, so the walk
credits `runningInclusiveHits` separately and `busy/exec` is running samples only. The mechanism
cost nothing to add because the photograph was already being taken.

**The caveat that was going to need a sample threshold did not survive contact with the design.**
Per-instance CPU and parallelism are not reported, so there is no biased subset to warn about. What
is reported per type is exact (the spans) or aggregated over the whole session (the sampled columns),
and neither needs a per-instance sample count.

**Parallelism is measured and not printed.** `inclusiveHits / instanceTicks` — threads per execution,
which is `work / span` in the work-span sense. It is **1.0 by construction** until a context can
cross a thread, so a column of ones would be noise; but the counter is built, and the bench asserts
it reads *exactly* 1.0000. That is the point of building it now: a known answer to calibrate the
instrument against, while the answer is still known. In phase 5 the same counter starts saying
something, and a missed hand-off has a signature it cannot hide.

### Bench work, and what it caught

`--coarse`, a switch of its own so the tier's cost is measurable against its own absence and every
figure already in findings.md stays comparable. Promoted against the boundary rather than by taste:
`checkpoint` (4710 ns) containing `maintain` (2560 ns), and `rankBatch` (1140 ns). `traverse` is the
**negative control** — 905 ns at a 65.2% share needs 2610 ns to qualify, so it stays fine-only and is
the standing illustration of why the fine tier exists. Plus `request`, a variable batch of 1–16
chunks, because percentiles over a distribution with no spread describe nothing.

The truth is stronger here than anywhere else in this project, and for a structural reason: **a span
is a quantity the bench can measure for itself.** A share had to be reconstructed from configuration
because nothing can time a 20 ns operation without destroying it; a request lasts hundreds of
microseconds, so each worker times every one of its own with the same two clock readings the profiler
uses, and the check is an identity rather than an estimate.

Four assertions, and three of them found real defects on the way:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| execution counts against the call graph | **exact, +0** on all three types |
| spans against the workers' own stopwatches | count exact; mean −0.01%; p50/p90/p99 **+0.00%** |
| breakdown against `subtree × measured self` | worst 1.72 pp against a 3.0 pp budget |
| parallelism | **exactly 1.0000** on all four types |

- **Counts came out 11.06% high**, identically on every type. That is the bench's warm-up, whose
  worker threads run before the measured run: the session reset was in the wrong place. The fine
  tier's `callsAtStart` snapshot had already found this exact failure once, in a different costume.
- **Then 0.21% low**, again identically. The reset had moved to the sampling thread, which races the
  caller: the workers were released while the sampler was still starting, so the first milliseconds
  of spans were recorded and then wiped. It resets on the caller's thread now, synchronously.
- **A p50 reading +7.70% high was the histogram behaving exactly as specified**, and it briefly
  looked like a defect. Reporting at the top of a bucket costs `9/8 − 1` = 12.5%, not the 6.25% a
  half-width suggests, and the true p50 had landed at the very bottom of its bucket. The
  documentation was wrong, not the code. The check now runs the workers' spans through the same
  histogram, so it measures whether the profiler recorded *the same intervals* rather than measuring
  the quantiser — and the answer is that it does, to the last bucket.
- **`max` is reported and never gated.** A maximum is one observation, the worker's stopwatch
  brackets the profiler's, and one Windows scheduling quantum between the two clock readings lands
  entirely on it — measured once at −16.93%, which is one descheduled thread and not a defect.

### The coarse tier on the three trials · **done**

Not a fourth phase-4 deliverable but the check the bench cannot give: the bench inherits our
assumptions, and every phase here has been validated on somebody else's code before moving on. Full
records in [trial-calcite.md](trial-calcite.md), [trial-netty.md](trial-netty.md) and
[trial-lucene.md](trial-lucene.md); what generalises is in [findings.md](findings.md#the-coarse-tier-on-foreign-code).

Each answered a different question, and the third answered one we did not ask:

- **Calcite — is a span right on code we did not write?** Yes, and provably: the harness has timed
  every plan since before this tier existed, and count, p50, p90 and p99 all agree to **+0.00%**.
  Nesting works (`plan ⊃ optimise ⊃ the rule labels`) and the cross-tabulation reads *of the 9.08 ms
  a plan takes, `FilterIntoJoinRule` is 25.2%* — the sentence the tier was justified by.
- **Netty — does it invent waiting?** No. `mean − busy/exec` is 0.1 µs of 14.5. A request on an event
  loop is pure CPU, and the column that would have been *occupancy* in the design this plan warned
  about reads zero.
- **Lucene — what happens when the obvious coarse operation does not fit the tier?** It fans a search
  across a pool, so the context stays on the caller. Same code and same label: **0.0% waiting at one
  thread, 24.5% at eight.** Without propagation, parallel work inside a coarse operation is reported
  as waiting. Both numbers are honest — the caller really is blocked — but the report cannot say the
  *request* was working. **That is phase 5's justification, measured rather than argued**, and the
  single-threaded row is what makes it a finding rather than a suspicion.

**And bracketing arrived for free**, as [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 13 predicted: unlabelled samples
under a context belong to that context, so *"the labels miss most of the run"* becomes *"three
quarters of a request is inside Netty's codec and write path"*.

## Phase 5 — crossing threads · done, and the trials said why

Where a logical operation stops being a thread-local concept.

### Start here — what a fresh session needs to know

**The defect, measured on real code.** Lucene fans a search across a pool, so the context stays on
the calling thread. Same code, same label, `--placement LABEL --coarse`:

```
--threads 1   mean 14.88 ms   busy/exec 14.87 ms   waiting  0.0%
--threads 8   mean  4.10 ms   busy/exec  3.10 ms   waiting 24.5%
```

**Without propagation, parallel work inside a coarse operation is reported as waiting.** Both numbers
are honest — the calling thread really is blocked — but the report cannot say the *request* was
working. That is this phase's justification, and the single-threaded row is what makes it a finding
rather than a suspicion. `docs/trial-lucene.md` has the full record.

**What is already built and must not be re-derived:**

- `CoarseContext` carries `parent` and `depth`; the slot holds it in `OpSlot.context`, read opaquely.
  Propagation is *save the reference, restore it on the other thread* — nothing else.
- **The parallelism counter exists and is silent.** `coarseInstanceTicks` is stamped on the context
  by the sampler, so `inclusiveHits / instanceTicks` is threads-per-execution. It reads **exactly
  1.0000** today, asserted by the bench in `VerifyCoarse.kt`, and that assertion is the thing to
  watch: the moment a context crosses a thread it must move, and a missed hand-off shows up as it
  stubbornly staying at 1.0.
- `Report.CoarseStat.parallelism` and `.inFlight` are computed and documented; only the column is
  withheld. `threads inside = in flight x parallelism` is the identity, and the naming is settled —
  see below.

**There is already a detector for the defect, and it is your acceptance test.** The report counts
labelled samples that fell under *no* coarse span, which is where escaped work goes. Baselines
measured before propagation exists:

| | outside every span |
|---|---|
| Calcite, Netty, Lucene at 1 thread | silent — below the 1% floor |
| **Lucene at 8 threads** | **88.5%**, naming `clause:prefix`, `clause:phrase`, … |

**After propagation, Lucene at 8 threads must collapse towards the others and the same-thread trials
must stay silent.** That is a pass/fail on real code, needing no new instrument, and it is more
sensitive than `waiting` — the same run reads 24.5% waiting against 88.5% here, because the calling
thread is doing plenty of work itself.

**Three checks to write before the mechanism:**

1. **Work per execution must not depend on thread count.** `busy/exec` at 1 thread and at N should
   agree; today Lucene loses 11.8 ms of 14.87. Cheapest sharp test there is —
   [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 22.
2. **Parallelism must stop being 1.0** on a fanned-out workload, and the bench's existing assertion
   must be inverted rather than deleted, so same-thread workloads still pin it at exactly 1.
3. **A context that outlives its span** — the detection mechanism for the contaminating direction,
   already named below.

**The bench cannot test this yet.** Its workers each run their own schedule and nothing is ever handed
between them, so building fork/join in the bench is a prerequisite, not a side quest — and phase 6
needs the same thing.

**What must not regress:** the four coarse checks passed on all twenty runs of the stability campaign
*because* they are clock-independent — spans against the same intervals, counts against counts. Keep
any new check the same shape; anything comparing an absolute duration across runs will be noise on
this machine.

**Propagation.** Every hand-off needs a hook: executors (wrap the `Runnable`), coroutines
(`ThreadContextElement`), `CompletableFuture` (through its executor), parallel streams
(`ForkJoinPool`). Threads created by hand cannot be caught automatically and need an explicit call.

**Coroutines are the hardest instance and get the most care.** Not because the mechanism differs —
mount and unmount is exactly save and restore — but because a *suspended* coroutine occupies no
thread at all. Nothing is sampled while it is suspended, so its CPU is correctly zero, but its
*span* keeps running. That is arguably right, and it must be a deliberate decision rather than an
accident.

**The failure mode to design against.** A missed hand-off fails silently and in the contaminating
direction: work inherits a stale context and is billed to the wrong logical operation, and nothing
in the output says so. Losing attribution is recoverable; inventing it is not. Worth a deliberate
detection mechanism — a context that outlives its span, say.

**Bench work, and it is substantial.** The bench currently has no work distribution at all: each
worker independently runs its own schedule. Testing cross-thread coarse operations needs fork and
join, which is also what phase 6 needs for occupancy that varies over time. Building it once serves
both.

**The graph-traversal workload is out of scope, and the objection came from this document.** It was
planned here — the supply-chain traversal is the shape the tool was built for and no trial covers
it — but the original is under NDA, so what could be built is our own reproduction of it: our code,
inheriting our assumptions, which is exactly the reason plan.md already gave for why it *cannot
substitute for pointing the tool at somebody else's*. A bench that is neither the real workload nor
somebody else's code earns nothing this phase does not already get from fork/join plus Lucene.
Recorded in [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 23 rather than deleted, because the argument may change if the
public form of the problem ever becomes writable.

**What this unlocks:** per-operation parallelism becomes real rather than trivially 1 — and the
`waiting` column stops charging a fanned-out request for work its own helper threads were doing.

**What it still will not answer, and the sweep will.** Propagation reports the parallelism you *are*
getting, at the thread count you happen to be running. It cannot say what a different thread count
would give, and that is the question anybody tuning a pool is actually asking. Changing the thread
count and re-running is the counterfactual for parallelism, the sibling of the disable-and-re-run
idea, and it survives this phase rather than being replaced by it —
[ideas.md](ideas.md) item 22, which already has its first data point.

### The order, and what each step has to show · settled 2026-08-30

Six steps. Each one is a commit, and each has a number that must move before the next begins.

| | | what it must show |
|---|---|---|
| **5a** | fork/join in the bench, **propagation off** · **done** | the defect reproduced where the truth is known: parallelism pinned at 1.0, the span accounting for 0.3% of its own work, 76% outside every span. [findings.md](findings.md#crossing-threads) |
| **5b** | `captureCoarse` / `withCoarse` and the wrappers · **done** | `inside` rises to the bench's measured fan-out — 4.00 against 4.00, within 0.1%; the span goes from accounting for 0.2% of its own work to 105%; outside-coarse collapses 76.4% → 0.0%. [findings.md](findings.md#propagation-and-the-same-three-numbers-inverted) |
| **5c** | the stale-context detector · **done** | `--fanout --escape` stages an un-joined chunk per request: 18.33% of coarse thread-time caught inside a finished execution, against **0.00%** with nothing staged. Fatal under strict, and both rungs of the ladder now fire under `--leakcheck`. [findings.md](findings.md#work-that-outlives-the-span-that-forked-it) |
| **5d** | the `inside` and `working` columns · **done in 5b** | landed with the mechanism rather than after it, because the pair is what the measurement is read through. See "Two parallelisms" below, which needed amending: there are three groupings, not two |
| **5e** | Lucene at eight threads, clock trace beside it · **done** | 88.5% outside-coarse went silent, `working` 0.76 → 6.32, `waiting` 24.2% → 3.8%, mean span unchanged at 4.0 ms. Calcite and Netty silent. [findings.md](findings.md#propagation-on-lucene-and-what-working-is-not) |
| **5f** | `profiler-coroutines`, a second module · **not built, and the reasoning is recorded** | the mechanism is `withCoarse` under another name, and without a coroutine workload it would be a mechanism nobody has watched work on anything real. What it would have taught us is written down instead — [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 25 |

**5a is a commit of its own, before any propagation exists.** It costs a round trip and it is the
discipline that caught the vacuous error bound in phase 3.5: measure the defect against a known
truth first, so that when the numbers move there is no question about what moved them.

*What 5a built.* `Fanout` — a helper pool sharing the workers' barrier, so one `stage()` call drives
every thread in the bench and the helpers take part in the **measure** stage as well as the run. That
last part is not decoration: fan-out moves the work off the drivers, and truth B is a per-thread
quantity, so without it the two-truths check would be pricing one set of threads' calls with another
set's clocks. `Worker.runFannedOut` is a loop of its own rather than a branch in the tuned one, and
the stall detector does not run in it — a driver parked on a join asked to be parked, and counting
that as preemption would report the workload as a machine fault.

*What it measured.* One driver against eight helpers reaches **4.24** threads per request by the
bench's own stopwatch while the profiler reports exactly **1.0000**, and the request's span accounts
for **0.3%** of the work that request did. Seven drivers against the same eight saturate the pool at
1.14 and the defect goes quiet — which is `CoarseStat.parallelism`'s documented caveat observed, and
the reason the assertions are gated on the bench's own measurement rather than run unconditionally.

*The two checks that outlive the defect.* Root calls conserved exactly, dispatched against executed,
in both configurations; and fan-out having demonstrably happened before anything is asserted about
it. Both are counts against counts, so they say the same thing at any clock — which mattered: the
clock fell from 205.5% to 144.4% of nominal across the four minutes of the run.

**Propagation is opt-in wrapping only, for now.** You wrap the `Runnable` or the executor yourself. A
hand-off you miss then shows up as *lost* attribution — outside-coarse rises, and the report already
names that — rather than as work silently billed to the wrong operation. An auto-wrapping helper is
the convenient version and its failure mode is the silent one, so the decision on whether it earns
its place waits until 5e says what Lucene actually needed. **Answered in 5e: it does not.** Lucene
needed one call at the one place the pool is constructed, so opt-in stays and no helper is built.

*What 5b built.* `captureCoarse()` on the forking thread, `withCoarse(ctx) { }` on the receiving one,
and wrappers over them: `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Executor`, `ExecutorService` and
`ScheduledExecutorService`. No dependency added, so the core POM still says it has none. **The
sampler was not touched** — `tickStamp` already counted an instance once per tick while
`inclusiveHits` counted every thread in it, so the ratio moved on its own the moment two threads held
one context.

*Wrapping the pool beat wrapping the task, and the first recommendation had it backwards.* The
argument against `ExecutorService.propagating()` was fifteen methods of boilerplate, "each a place a
hand-off can be missed" — but most of those methods carry no task at all and only eight accept work.
The safety runs the other way: wrap the pool once and you cannot forget a task, wrap tasks and every
new call site is a fresh chance to. `submit` is also what people actually write.

*Capture is at wrap time, and that is the one way to get this wrong that still compiles.* Capturing
when the task runs would pick up the pool thread's context, which is empty, and propagate nothing —
silently. `PropagateTest` has a test whose only job is to fail if somebody moves it.

*`schedule` deliberately does not propagate.* A task that runs in five minutes will usually outlive
the execution that scheduled it, and crediting it there **invents** attribution rather than losing
it. The undelayed methods on the same pool still propagate, so it is a property of the method and
not of the wrapper giving up on scheduled pools.

*The escaping arm survives as a switch.* `--propagate=off` still runs 5a's three assertions, and the
mount is branched around rather than passed a null, so that arm executes the code 5a measured. The
before and the after are an A/B inside one binary rather than a claim about a build nobody can run.

*What 5c built.* A `closed` flag on `CoarseContext`, written once by the owner as it restores its
slot and read by the sampler for every occupied context it visits. Samples caught under a closed
execution are counted separately and **excluded** from everything that type reports — crediting them
lets `busy/exec` exceed the mean span it sits inside, which is impossible arithmetic that reads as a
finding. Fatal under strict above a share, with a minimum sample count beside it so that a handful of
samples is never evidence.

*The check needed a second read, and finding that out cost a run.* The sampler reads a slot's context
and reads the closed flag microseconds later, and a clean join goes through exactly that gap: the
helper releases the context, and only then can the owner close it. A correct run read **1.14%** stale
and the strict check stopped it one second into sixty. The answer is not a wider threshold but asking
a sharper question — on seeing a closed context, re-read the slot and ask whether the thread is still
in it. Benign, and it has already gone; real, and it stays for as long as the work does. Clean runs
then read 0.00%.

*What this unlocks, and it is why the ordering put it here.* The standing argument against
propagating automatically is that it would carry a context into fire-and-forget work that outlives
the request — inventing attribution, which nothing could then detect. Something can now detect it.
That does not settle the auto-wrap question on its own — 5e did, and the answer was that opt-in
sufficed — but it removes the objection that would have made an agent unsafe in phase 7.

*What 5e measured.* One `.propagating()` call on the pool the Lucene harness hands to
`IndexSearcher`, behind `--propagate` so the before and after are one binary. The escape line went
from **88.5%** to silent, `working` from 0.76 to **6.32**, `waiting` from 24.2% to **3.8%** — and the
mean span did not move, 3.98 ms against 4.01 ms, so the program was not changed, only what could be
seen of it. Both controls stayed silent. Four windows within 3% of each other on the clock, so none
of it is the machine.

*And it found a sentence that fan-out had made false.* `busy/exec` is thread-time summed over the
threads in an execution — `busy/exec = working x mean` — so a 4.01 ms search with 6.32 threads inside
reports 25.31 ms. The legend said *"mean - busy/exec is the WAITING"*, which was true only while
nothing could cross a thread. Corrected in `render()` and [output.md](output.md); `waiting` is the
reading that holds either way.

*The larger finding: `working` is not the speedup.* Same session, same binary — 14.04 ms at one
thread against 4.01 ms at eight is a **3.50x** speedup, while `working` reads **6.32**, because the
parallel run spends **1.80x more total CPU** on the same query. `working` therefore bounds the
speedup from above and can overstate it badly. That is now stated wherever the column is documented,
and it sharpens [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 22 rather than competing with it: only re-running at
another thread count can see the extra work, so only the sweep answers *what did parallelism buy*.

*The auto-wrap decision, which 5b parked here.* **Opt-in stays; no auto-wrapping helper is built.**
Lucene needed exactly one call, at the one place the pool is constructed, and a helper would have
saved nothing. The caveat that argues the other way is untouched: this pool is ours to wrap, and a
target that builds its own internally cannot be wrapped from outside at all — which is the bytecode
agent in phase 7, not a helper here.

*And 5f was dropped, on the argument that descoped the traversal bench.* The coroutines module was in
the plan because the workload this project came from uses them. That workload left as
[ideas.md](ideas.md) item 23 — NDA, and a reproduction is our code inheriting our assumptions — and
the same reasoning finishes the job here: the mechanism is `withCoarse` under another name, and with
no coroutine workload to point it at, it is a mechanism nobody has watched work on anything real.
That is the criticism this project levels everywhere else.

**What it would have taught us is worth more than the module, and costs nothing to write down.** A
suspended coroutine occupies no thread at all, which makes it the one kind of waiting this tool
cannot get wrong — where a thread blocked in a socket read reads `RUNNABLE` and was measured at 55x
out in [trial 4](trial-jdbc.md). Waiting becomes visible as *absence* rather than as a state to
interrogate. Two caveats fall out with it, and both are recorded in item 25.

### Two parallelisms, and the identity that relates them · settled before any of it was built, amended in 5b

**Amendment, 2026-08-30: there are three groupings of the sample stream, not two, and the third was
missed here because it does not exist until a context can cross a thread.** Everything below stands;
what it calls "parallelism" turned out to be two numbers rather than one.

Group by the context instance and a *further* split appears — whether the thread a sample caught was
on a CPU. Both halves are wanted, and they answer questions that lead to opposite decisions:

- **`inside`** — threads in one execution, a parked one counted. What a request *ties up*. This is
  the half that keeps the identity below exact, because `in flight` counts an execution whether or
  not its threads are running and a factorisation has to count both sides the same way.
- **`working`** — of those, the ones on a CPU. What splitting the request *bought*: `work / span`,
  the `T₁/T∞` this section already describes, and what the literature means by the word.

`working = inside × (1 - waiting)`, so they differ by exactly a column the coarse table already
printed. The bench makes the gap concrete: a driver that fans work out and parks on the join is one
thread inside and zero working, and `working` recovers that from thread state without being told —
4.00 inside against 3.01 working, the difference being 0.99 of a driver.

**Why one number would not have done.** The text below reserves "parallelism" for the code-not-load
quantity, which is `working`. But the report is occupancy-based everywhere else — `share`,
`occupancy` and `in flight` all count a waiting thread in full — so printing only `working` would
have made this column the odd one out in its own table *and* broken the identity. Printing only
`inside` would have answered the capacity question and silently mis-answered the speedup one, which
is the question the section below is mostly about.

### Two parallelisms, and the identity that relates them · settled before any of it was built

There will be two numbers in the report that both look like "parallelism", and they are different
groupings of the *same* sample stream. Naming them apart is not cosmetic — it is the difference
between two findings that want opposite fixes.

- **In flight** — group samples by the *label*. How many executions of it were running at once.
  This is the fine tier's `occupancy ÷ elapsed`, and it is what the column called `threads` has
  always been. The standard name for it is the queueing one: the number in the system, `L`.
- **Parallelism** — group samples by the *context instance*. How many threads were working on one
  execution: `work ÷ span`, which is the work-span model's `T₁/T∞` and the word's textbook meaning.
  Phase 5, and it does not exist before then.

Both names are taken from the literature rather than invented here, and the second one is what
anybody already means by "parallelism" — which is exactly why the fine column must not use the word.
"Fan-out" was the first candidate and was dropped: common in distributed systems, but it is not what
the quantity is called where it is defined.

**The fine-tier number is in-flight parallelism, and it is structurally incapable of being
anything else.** A fine operation is atomic and never leaves the thread that entered it — a
suspending or handing-off body is by construction not fine — so one thread inside the label is
exactly one execution of it, and counting threads and counting concurrent executions are the same
count. Fan-out needs an execution to have an identity a second thread can be handed; a fine
operation is an integer in a slot and can never have one.

The two compose exactly, being the same sum sliced two ways:

```
threads inside a coarse type = executions in flight  ×  parallelism per execution
```

Eight threads in a label is `8 × 1` — eight serial requests, so parallelise a request, the machine is
already full — or `2 × 4` — two requests on four threads each, so look elsewhere for the latency.
The fine tier cannot tell those apart and does not claim to; it measures the first factor, and only
a coarse context can measure the second.

**Only the second factor is about the code, and the report has to say so.** The first tracks the
deployment and nothing else: by Little's law the mean number in a system is `L = λ·W`, so twice the
clients is twice the number with the program unchanged. Two corrections to that, both needed for the
statement to be true — the column is not `L`, because it divides by the ticks where the operation was
occupied rather than by all of them, giving `λ·W·parallelism / p_active`; and it cannot grow without
limit, because there are only so many threads and the surplus queues outside the label instead:

```
threads inside = min( λ · W · parallelism , P )
```

Below the ceiling it tracks the arrival rate; at the ceiling it reports the pool size. So it is
printed as a ratio — `3.28/8` — because the ratio is the one part of it that is a finding: near the
ceiling means the pool is pinned inside this label. It stays in the table because `elapsed` cannot be
computed without it, not because it diagnoses anything alone.

Parallelism does not move under any of that: a request that splits four ways splits four ways for one
client or a thousand. The honest caveat is that what gets *measured* is `min(what the code could do,
threads actually free)`, so a saturated pool reads it low — a real limit on the number, and one the
report will have to state rather than a defect in the naming.

**Done already, on the coarse-tier branch:** the column is named `in flight` rather than `threads`
and printed over the thread count as `3.28/8`, in `render()`, in
[output.md](output.md#in-flight-counts-executions-not-the-threads-spent-on-one-of-them) and in
`OperationStat.inFlight`, which was `concurrency`. Renamed *before* the second number exists, because
a reader who has learned `threads` to mean per-request parallelism will not un-learn it when a second
column appears beside it. `parallelism` is reserved for that column and used for nothing else.

**What it buys phase 4 and phase 5.** The identity is a cross-check, not just a naming rule. Phase 4
is same-thread, so parallelism must come out **exactly 1.0** — a known answer to measure against, in the
same build-the-truth-first discipline as everything else here. Anything else means the instance
stamping is broken, and we find that out while the truth is still known. In phase 5 the same counter
starts saying something, and a missed hand-off has a signature it cannot hide: parallelism that stays
stubbornly at 1.0.

Measuring it costs one counter. The sampler already does `if (seenAt[op] != ticks) activeTicks[op]++`
to count an operation's ticks rather than its slots; counting *occupied instances* per tick is the
identical idiom with the stamp on the context object instead of in an array — one write per live
context per tick, on the thread that has a core to itself.

## Trial 4 — PostgreSQL over a socket · done, and it found a defect

**Three trials in and nothing has ever waited.** Calcite plans on one thread and is pure CPU. Lucene's
index is page-cached, so its clauses read `waiting 0.0%`. Netty's request is loopback and
`mean - busy/exec` reads 0.0% — this document calls it the negative control. So the coarse tier's
headline claim, *"`mean - busy/exec` is the waiting, which is the one thing a fine label can never
tell you"*, has never been checked against foreign code whose answer was anything but zero. The only
waiting with a known truth anywhere in the project is our own `ContendedLock` in the bench.

**And phase 5b made that gap urgent rather than merely untidy.** `working` is now a printed column,
and it is built on `Thread.getState`, which [findings.md](findings.md#the-column-is-blind-to-native-waiting-and-an-event-loop-is-native-waiting)
already records as blind to native waits: a thread stopped inside a socket read is `RUNNABLE` as far
as Java is concerned. If that blindness bites, `working` counts blocked threads as working and
`waiting` under-reports — on exactly the workload where the distinction is the reason anyone opened
the report. This is not a coverage exercise; it is a test of whether a column shipped four commits
ago is honest.

**The truth is the operating system's, which is what makes the question answerable.**
`ThreadMXBean.getThreadCpuTime` counts time on a processor and sees through the JNI boundary that
thread state cannot. So:

```
working x mean span x executions      what the profiler says the requests spent on a CPU
CPU the process actually used         what the OS says it spent
```

Both directions are informative and only one is a defect. The OS figure should be the larger — it
counts threads the span does not cover, the JIT and the sampler included. A profiler figure *above*
it is thread-time the machine never spent, and the only way to get that is by counting threads that
were stopped.

**What is built:** `trial-jdbc`, a fourth module. PostgreSQL in a container driven by plain
`docker run` rather than Testcontainers, because Testcontainers would bring its own threads into the
process being profiled and every share in the report is taken over the threads the sampler can see.
Five million rows generated server-side and reused between runs. A request fans out across a
HikariCP pool and an executor wrapped with `.propagating()`, behind `--propagate` so the before and
after are one binary, as on Lucene. Fine labels separate `acquire` — queueing on ourselves — from
`execute`, which is the database taking its time.

**What it found, and it is the point of running trials at all.** `working` reads **55x** more CPU
than the operating system says the process spent: 56.99 s attributed against 1.03 s actually used.
Java reports a thread inside a native call as `RUNNABLE`, so eight threads stopped in a socket read
were counted as 2.85 threads working, and `execute` held 99.97% of the run at `waiting 0.0%`. The
report's own duty-cycle header said *"threads were on CPU 0.63% of sampled wall time"* twenty lines
above the column that contradicted it.

**The fix is a bound, not a correction.** `working` now prints as `2.83/0.04` when the measured CPU
duty cycle cannot support it, with a warning naming the type — both readings stated, because the
column is right on a CPU-bound operation and only the reader knows which they have. The ceiling is
`inside x labelledDuty` with a factor of 1.5, and that factor is load-bearing: Lucene reads
`working 6.40` against a ceiling of 6.40 and Calcite 1.00 against 0.97, so a strict test would have
accused both of the defect PostgreSQL actually has.

Full record in [trial-jdbc.md](trial-jdbc.md); the measurement is in
[findings.md](findings.md#working-counts-a-thread-stopped-in-a-socket-read-as-working--by-55x).

## Phase 6 — thread state and the whole-application coefficient · partly done

### What is built · **done**

The fine-tier half — thread state per operation, and per-operation concurrency. Every number in
[findings.md](findings.md#thread-state-beside-the-label).

`OpSlot` carries a **weak** reference to its thread, so the sampler can ask its state without
pinning a thread that dies without releasing. Each tick the walk reads that state and, for a slot
inside a label, counts the hit as waiting when the thread is not runnable; separately it stamps the
operation as *seen this tick*, which counts ticks and not slots and so measures the operation's
wall-clock footprint. Three columns follow: **waiting**, **elapsed**, and **in-flight** — the last two
being `activeTicks × step` and `hits / activeTicks`.

**Verified against a second truth that shares nothing with it.** Under the contended lock at 1.60
utilisation, 52,422 of `lockedUpdate`'s 71,839 hits caught a thread that was not runnable — **52.483
s of waiting against 52.482 s** summed by the waiting threads' own `nanoTime` brackets. Every other
operation in the same run, none of which can block, read **0.00%**; and on the ordinary bench, where
preemption takes 30% of the wall time, everything reads 0.0% too, because a preempted thread is
`RUNNABLE` and this column is for waiting another thread caused.

**What it cost:** the slot walk goes from ~190 ns to ~284 ns per slot, which at eight slots is
0.75 µs of a 1 ms tick and does not move the achieved step. The effect on the workers could not be
measured — this machine's throughput varies by 29% between runs of the same configuration, which is
more than any difference between configurations. Recorded as inconclusive rather than as a number.

**The scaling limit, which is new and matters:** at the 1024-slot ceiling that same per-slot cost is
~95 µs per tick, about 10% of the step. Eight threads is free and a thousand is not — and a thousand
slots is exactly what the virtual-thread hazard produces.

### The design is now settled, and the platform settled it

**Phase 6's coefficient cannot be built on CPU time.** Measured 2026-08-30 with `--cpucost`: reading
another thread's CPU costs **284.7 ns** and a walk of eight threads **2.3 µs**, which is 0.2% of a
1 ms step — so cost was never the obstacle, and the 130.9 µs this plan reasoned from is the *dearest
walk observed over a run* rather than a call cost, overstating it by about 57x. The obstacle is the
**resolution: 15.625 ms, sixteen times the sampling step**, and no implementation gets around a
scheduler quantum. See
[findings.md](findings.md#reading-a-threads-cpu-is-cheap-its-clock-is-16x-too-coarse-to-use-per-tick)
and [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 24, now closed.

**So it is built on thread state, with the bound printed beside it** — the form `working` adopted
after [trial 4](trial-jdbc.md) measured thread state wrong by 55x on a workload that waits outside
the JVM. Build the histogram on the state the sampler can read every tick; carry the per-window duty
cycle alongside; and where the two disagree, say so rather than printing one of them alone. The limit
below is therefore not a caveat to design around — it is the shape of the answer.

### What is not built



Sample the thread's state alongside the label. From that, a histogram of how often 1, 2, 3, … N
threads were busy, and the parallelism coefficient as its mean.

The sampler snapshots every thread at one instant, which is what makes this possible — a profiler
that sums time per thread has destroyed the information before you can ask. This is the one thing
an async-profiler bridge could never provide, since it samples each thread on its own timer signal.

**This phase is worth more than it looks, and the reason came out of settling the tier boundary.**
Thread state is not one feature among several — paired with per-operation concurrency
([ideas.md](ideas.md) item 16) it closes **three** of the ways the fine tier fails at once, and both
halves come from photographs the sampler already takes:

- it answers *waiting or working* per operation, rather than as one aggregate bound over the run;
- it **detects the bimodal operation** — a label that is 50 ns on the fast path and 100 µs when it
  hits a lock reports 150 ns and describes nothing, and today nothing signals it, because a 100 µs
  slow path is a tenth of a tick and invisible to the long-instance detector too. Under sampled
  state that label shows two thirds of its samples parked, which is not a subtle signal;
- and with concurrency as the divisor it turns occupancy back into **wall time** —
  `elapsed = occupancy ÷ mean concurrency while active` — which is the one thing summed occupancy
  can never be. Worked in [profiler.md](profiler.md#turning-occupancy-back-into-wall-time), where
  the same 100 thread-seconds of waiting means *6.7 s, break up the convoy* or *59 s, design the
  contention out* depending only on the divisor.

**The limit to design around:** `RUNNABLE` means *eligible*, not *on a core*. It covers a preempted
thread — 14–18% on a bench that never blocks — and a thread in a blocking socket read, which the JVM
cannot see into. `BLOCKED`/`WAITING`/`TIMED_WAITING` are conclusive; `RUNNABLE` is not, and closing
that gap needs the per-thread duty cycle, [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 10.

**What can be done now:** the occupancy histogram, and the busy-versus-throughput curves across
`--sweep`, validated against starvation mode's known constant answer.

**What needs something the bench does not have:** the heuristic that distinguishes "executing" from
"spinning in the dispatcher" from "parked" needs something dispatcher-shaped to test against, and
our workers just loop. It arrives with phase 5's fork/join, or with coroutines.

**And the diagnosis, not just the mechanism.** Starvation mode proves the sampler can count busy
threads. It cannot prove the interesting claim — telling "steadily 3 busy, structural width limit"
from "sawtooth spiking to 16, barrier costs", which both average to 3. That needs occupancy that
varies over time, and the ground truth for it has to be *recorded* (per-phase timestamps) rather
than computed, because occupancy is emergent rather than configured.

## The project is called TickSnick · 2026-08-31

Renamed from `profiler`, domain **ticksnick.com**. Four decisions, recorded because a later session
will otherwise have to reconstruct them from a diff:

- **Package and coordinates are `com.ticksnick`**, the reverse of the domain, which is the
  convention and is collision-proof because the domain is owned. `com.ticksnick:ticksnick:0.1.0`.
  The previous `com.minogin` namespace was dropped rather than nested under, since the project is
  the thing being published and not one of several under a personal namespace.
- **The `Profiler` object keeps its name.** `Profiler.registerFine(...)` says what it does;
  `TickSnick.registerFine(...)` would say who made it. Library entry points are named for the job.
  The brand lives in the package, the artifact and the banner, where a caller meets it once instead
  of at every call site.
- **Repository is `minogin/ticksnick`**, and the POM url and scm point there.
- **The banner says TICKSNICK**, in the same block font it used for PROFILER.

*Mechanically:* 47 files moved from `com.minogin.profiler` to `com.ticksnick` with `git mv` so the
history follows, `rootProject.name`, `artifactId`, `group`, the jar's bench exclusion and the
application main class all updated. Nothing about the code changed.

## The toolchain · Gradle 9.7.1, Kotlin 2.4.0, JDK 21 everywhere

Bumped 2026-08-31 from Gradle 9.6.0 / Kotlin 2.3.21. Recorded because **every measurement in
[findings.md](findings.md) predates the Kotlin bump**, and this library leans on value classes and
inline functions whose generated shapes are exactly what it measures. Nothing in the source changed,
so nothing is expected to move — but "the same binary" stopped being literally true across that
boundary. If a close comparison against an older figure ever looks odd, the compiler version is a
candidate that was not there before, and `--hook` is the cheap way to re-check.

**And on 2026-08-31 the JDK toolchain went to 21 in every module.** The library had been moved to 21
already, for the reason recorded in `build.gradle.kts` — a profiler nobody can put on the classpath is
not released — but the sandbox and the five trials were left on 26, which was the original
project-wide default and never had an argument behind it. Nothing in any module uses an API newer
than 21, and every trial dependency has a floor below it.

It surfaced from the sandbox: `:sandbox:run` died with a `LinkageError`, because 26 compiled it to
class file version 70 while the JDK on PATH here is 21. The 26 toolchain resolved only to
IntelliJ's `~/.jdks/openjdk-26.0.2`, so the module built under the IDE and could not be launched
outside it — the exact opposite of what the sandbox is for, which is to sit where a stranger sits.

**The same caveat as the Kotlin bump applies, one layer down:** every trial number in
[findings.md](findings.md) was produced on a JDK 26 runtime, and the trials now run on 21. Nothing in
the source changed. If a close comparison against an older trial figure ever looks odd, the JVM is
now a second candidate alongside the compiler.

## The API rename · done, out of phase order

Not a phase, and it jumped the queue because the sandbox found it: `Profiler.register` and
`Profiler.registerCoarse` both returned a bare `Int` from counters that both start at zero, so the
first fine operation and the first coarse one were **the same number**. `op(request)` compiled, ran,
and reported a plausible wrong answer — silent misattribution, which is the one failure this project
treats as unacceptable everywhere else.

**The shape came from the observation that fine and coarse is a property of the instrument, not of
the program.** A coarse label gives everything a fine one gives *plus* measured spans, percentiles
and a breakdown, so the only question is whether the operation can afford ~40 ns. That is decided
once, when you are judging the size of the thing:

```kotlin
val parse   = Profiler.registerFine("parse")     // FineOp
val request = Profiler.registerCoarse("request") // CoarseOp

op(parse) { }   ;   op(request) { }              // one verb, the handle decides
Profiler.enter(op)  ;  Profiler.exit(op)         // replaces enterCoarse/exitCoarse too
```

**What it buys beyond safety.** The report already advises *"the operation wants a coarse label for
its per-execution statistics"*. Acting on that used to mean changing the registration **and** every
call site; now it is one word in one place, and reversible if the cost turns out not to be worth it.

**`exit` takes what it closes**, which the no-argument form could not: `enter(a); enter(b); exit();
exit()` unwinds `b` then `a` whether or not that was meant. A crossed pair is now counted, named and
fatal under `strict`.

**What it cost.** About 150 call sites across the library, bench, four trials, sandbox and tests, all
found by the compiler. Two constraints discovered on the way, both now documented where they bite:
`@JvmField` cannot be applied to a value-class property, which the Netty trial and Lucene's `Clause`
were both relying on; and value classes mangle their JVM names, which makes the API **uncallable from
Java source** until phase 7 adds `@JvmName` — [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 26, with the fix verified.

**Also done here:** the coarse table gained `share` and `occupancy`, which the fine table had all
along. Coarse was already strictly more informative in the data; only the printed report was short.

## `stepMillis` is not a resolution dial · 2026-09-02

Decided while reading the empty-table message in the sandbox, and recorded because the code now says
*less* than it used to and a later reader would otherwise read the deletion as an oversight.

The message on a run too short to sample used to end *"Run for longer, or lower stepMillis."* The
second clause is unreachable: the message fires below 50 ticks, and a 2 ms run would need a 0.04 ms
step to clear that bar — a sampler waking 25,000 times a second, measuring itself, for fifty samples
that still say nothing. It now says **"Run for longer."** and the README no longer describes the
step as trading samples against sampler CPU.

**What replaced that framing.** The step is a knob for *thread count*, and it points upward: the
sampler walks every registered slot every tick, which is 0.2% of a 1 ms step at 8 threads and about
10% of it at the 1024-slot ceiling. The floor is the machine and it is close — spin achieves 1.001 ms
at a 1 ms request where parking cannot — so there is little room below the default and a real reason
to go above it.

**Deliberately not built:** having the profiler derive the step from the live slot count, or warn
when the walk is eating the tick. Both are plausible and neither is measured — nothing below 1 ms has
been characterised at all. Kept as [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 34, together with the sweep that would
settle it.

## One warning section, numbered and capped · 2026-09-02

Warnings used to be printed where each was computed, which scattered them: the fine tier's floor and
long-execution warnings landed *after* the coarse table, and the coarse tier's open-context warning
inside it. A reader who found one had no way to know it was about the table two sections up. Found
in the sandbox, where a 50 ns floor warning about a fine operation read as being about a coarse one.

They are now collected by `renderWarnings()` into a single `WARNINGS (n)` section after both tables,
numbered, each entry hanging-indented under its own number.

**Why the word and not the `!`.** The [severity ladder](#what-the-tool-does-about-it--the-severity-ladder)
already separates *fatal* from *warning* from *note*, and the report was spending the same `!` on all
three. The section now carries the word, which is what the ladder always meant; the fatal blocks keep
their own full-width banners, and notes - the stuck baseline, the noise floor - stay beside the
numbers they qualify.

**Capped at ten** (`MAX_WARNINGS`), with the remainder counted rather than listed, for the same
reason zero-hit operations are folded: Calcite produces one warning per rule, and a section that runs
to fifty entries teaches the reader to skip the section.

## The `Threads` denominator is per operation · 2026-09-02

`Concurrency / Threads` used to divide by `Report.threads` - the run's slot high-water mark - on
every row. That is the pool an operation could spread over only when every thread does everything,
which is true of the bench and of the four trials and false of the first sandbox that put a `main`
thread beside a pool. Recorded because the column's meaning changed while its heading did not.

**What it is now:** `OperationStat.threads`, the distinct threads that *called* the operation during
the session. Callers rather than samples on purpose - a thread that entered once and was never
sampled still ran it, and `1.00 / 1` should mean *serial by construction*, which is a fact about the
code and not about the run.

**How it is counted, and why it is free.** Live threads are read at `stop()` from the per-operation
counters the hook writes anyway. Exiting threads are counted where their counters are already being
folded into `retiredCounts` (`release`, `reclaimDeadSlots`) - the last point at which the identity of
who contributed still exists. Nothing was added to the hot path.

**Session-scoped by subtraction**, mirroring `sessionCalls`: the sampler snapshots the count at
`start()`. This is what keeps the bench honest, since its warm-up runs on a separate set of workers
that exit before the measured run - the same defect that `callsAtStart` exists to prevent, which
once had the floor check accusing a 20 ns operation of being under 7.9 ns. The failure mode it
costs, named rather than hidden: a thread that called the operation before `start()` **and** goes on
calling it during the session is subtracted out. Threads created after `start()` are exact, which is
every case the bench, the trials and the sandbox have.

**Deliberately not built:** a per-slot snapshot that would make the cross-session case exact too. It
is 32 KB of bitset in the sampler for a case nothing here exhibits.

## `Concurrency`, `Workers`, `Pool` · 2026-09-02

Three columns where there was one pair, after three tries at the same question - *how did this
operation use threads?* Written down because two of the three answers were true numbers that
answered something else, and the next person to look at the column will reach for them again.

1. **`Concurrency / Threads`, threads being the run's slot high-water mark.** Right only where every
   thread does everything, which is the bench and all four trials.
2. **`Concurrency / Threads`, threads being the distinct callers.** Exact, and still not about
   parallelism: a sandbox pool of four running three tasks at a time printed `3.00 / 4`, where the 4
   is a `ThreadPoolExecutor` detail - it opens a new core thread on every submit until the core size
   is reached, idle workers or not. Andrey: *"it does not say anything about how we actually
   parallelize the work, and in this case we always run only 3 threads."*
3. **`Concurrency / Peak`.** The maximum is the right third number, but the pair is wrong: it reads
   as the name of one quantity - peak concurrency - while the number to its left is a mean, and a
   fractional average and an integer maximum are not two views of one whole the way `Runnable /
   Wait` is.

**The shape that survived:** `Concurrency` (mean threads inside), `Workers` (most at one tick),
`Pool` (distinct threads that ever called it). No slash between them - each is its own measure with
its own heading. The names are Andrey's, and they ended an argument that better arguments had not:
`Peak` invites *peak of what*, and `Threads` beside a column already about threads says nothing.

**Concurrency is a count, which the ratio hides.** `thread-time / wall-time = hits / activeTicks`,
and `hits` is the sum of threads-inside over ticks while `activeTicks` counts them, so the ratio is
`mean(k)` and `Workers` is `max(k)` of the same series. Worth stating because "concurrency is not a
number of threads at all" is a reasonable reading of a ratio of two times, and it is wrong.

**What `Workers` costs:** two array writes per labelled slot per tick, on the sampling thread,
inside a walk that already reads every slot. The hook is untouched. It is a lower bound, like every
sampled number, so the serialization warning it feeds asks for `MIN_HITS_FOR_SERIAL` (25) hits
first - `Workers 1` from a handful of samples is what a *short* operation looks like, not a
serialized one.

**The naming objections, and why they did not survive.** Two were raised against `Workers` and
`Pool` and both were wrong. *That `Workers` says nothing about "at once", where `Max` or `Peak`
would* - backwards: `Max` names a statistic and leaves the noun to the reader, while `Workers` names
what was counted, and "detected" is a more honest word for a sampled maximum than "peak" is. *That
`Pool` would lie on a thread-per-task workload by printing ten thousand* - that deployment really
does have ten thousand threads, and printing it describes the shape correctly.

**What the three columns are for, in one reading:** *concurrency 1.1, so concurrency here is poor;
workers 2, but I dispatched 3, so something is off; pool 4, which is what I configured.* The middle
comparison - against what the reader **intended** - is the one nothing else in the report supports,
and it is the argument for the column: `Concurrency` cannot make it, since a mean of 1.1 is
consistent with two workers or eight, and `Pool` cannot, since the threads exist either way.

## One table for both tiers · 2026-09-02

`FINE OPERATIONS` is now `ALL OPERATIONS` and carries a row per coarse operation as well, starred.
Andrey's, from the premise this project had been repeating without following: *a coarse label gives
you everything a fine one does and more*. If that is true, promoting an operation should not move it
to a different table with different columns - which is the report's shape changing with the label
rather than with the program.

**What made it possible, and it is not what item 28 is about.** The blocker looked like
inclusive-versus-self: coarse numbers are inclusive by construction, the fine table is a self-time
ranking, and mixing them puts a parent above its own children with the column summing past 100%.
That is true of the *measured spans* - subtracting a child's timed span from its parent's is item 28,
with the cross-thread race it names. It is not true of the sampled numbers, which is all the table
needs: the sampler already knows the innermost coarse type and whether a fine label is open, so
**one counter** at a site that had both in hand gives the coarse operation's own work.

- `coarseSelfHits[t]` - innermost coarse `t`, no fine label - with its runnable, active-tick, and
  peak counterparts, all in the same branch.
- `Pool` for a coarse row comes from the per-slot span aggregates, which `resetCoarse` already
  scopes to the session, so it needs no snapshot the way the fine side does.

**The partition is the whole argument.** A fine operation's hits are the samples where it was the
innermost label; a coarse operation's self hits are the samples inside its span with no fine label.
Disjoint, and together every labelled sample - so one share column ranks both tiers and adds to
100%. In the demo: four fine operations at 40.3, 39.4, 11.3 and 6.4%, `request *` at 2.5%, and the
`was made of` line under the coarse table reports the same 2.5% as its unlabelled share.

**It fixed a bug nobody had noticed.** `labelledHits` was the fine sum, so time inside a coarse span
with no fine label counted as *outside every operation*. A run labelled only with coarse spans
reported **zero coverage**. The split is now `labelledHits = fineHits + coarseSelfHits` and
`unlabelledHits = idleHits - coarseSelfHits`, with the coverage block reading the second.

**One provenance per column.** Every column in the merged table is sampled, both tiers. The coarse
tier knows two of them exactly - the measured span mean, and wall time as a union of measured
intervals - and using them would make a column whose rows are exact or inferred with nothing saying
which, and whose values answer different questions: inclusive wall per execution against self
thread-time per call. Those stay in the coarse table. `Over 1t` prints `-` for a coarse row for the
same reason in reverse: it is a fine-tier threshold, and the percentiles below answer it exactly.

**Both headings now say which time they are**, `ALL OPERATIONS - own time` and `COARSE OPERATIONS -
inclusive time`, because the same operation appears in both with different numbers - `request` at
5.03% of its own work in one and 99.6% including what it contains in the other - and two words at
the place the eye lands is cheaper than a reader deciding one of them is a bug.

**The one friction, accepted knowingly.** A coarse operation's `Concurrency` in the merged table is
about its own work; the coarse table's `parallelism:` line is inclusive, over the whole span. In the
sandbox that is 1.0 against 4.0 for the same name. Three things carry it: the two tables use
different words (the coarse table says *threads per execution* and *executions at once*, never
`concurrency`), the `was made of` line reconciles them on screen, and the star's key says the row is
the operation's own work. If it still reads as a contradiction in use, the fallback is to print the
self figure beside the inclusive one in the coarse table - not done up front, for a confusion nobody
has hit yet.

## Three significant digits, everywhere · 2026-09-02

Andrey, reading `12835.38 ms`: *we never need more than three meaningful digits.* Right, and the
number was also evidence of a missing branch - `duration()` stopped at milliseconds, so every coarse
total, mean and percentile above a second printed as a pile of them, an eight-minute total reading
`478505.87 ms`.

Both formatters now go through one ladder - ns, us, ms, s, then min above a thousand seconds and h
above a thousand minutes - at three significant digits. `threadTime` survives as a name because it
says which quantity a call site is printing, but it is `duration`. The two existed because one
stopped too low and the other started too high; a ladder answers both and there is nothing left for
a second implementation to do.

Percentages follow the same rule, also Andrey's: `40.3%`, not `40.308%`. **Sorting and arithmetic use
the full value; three digits is only what is shown.**

Two details that are not obvious and were both found in the output:

- **A rounded value moves up a unit rather than growing a fourth digit.** 999.7 ms is `1.00 s`, never
  `1000 ms`, so the unit is chosen again after rounding.
- **`100%` is reserved for a real 100.** Rounding 99.997% to `100%` printed `100% / 0.003%` for a
  pair whose halves are supposed to add up on the page as well as in the arithmetic. Anything in
  between now prints `>99.9%`.

**Why three and not four.** The fourth digit is never evidence: a sampled share carries a noise floor
printed two columns away - typically 0.2-0.5% - and the coarse percentiles come from a histogram
that reports the top of a bucket, about 1%. `44.250%` invited comparisons between operations that
differ by less than the error on either of them.

## `Paused`: lateness summed, whatever caused it · 2026-10-01

Came out of the first run on a workload that allocates - the graph benchmark, 9 GB live under G1 -
where the header read `1.109 ms mean` against a 1 ms request and `Time on CPU 88.97%` with nothing
on the page saying why. The measurement is in [findings.md](findings.md); this is what was decided.

**What is built.** The sampler adds up how late each tick ran, counting only ticks a whole step
late (`PauseTracker`, one subtraction and one compare per tick, sampler thread only). The header
prints the total as `Paused`, under `Sampling`, and beside it `GC`: the JVM's own collection-pause
count over the session, read from `GarbageCollectorMXBean` at `start()` and `stop()`.

**Everything late is summed, with no attempt to say what it was.** Andrey: *"just sum up all lost
time no matter what exactly that was."* The sampler cannot tell a collection from another safepoint
or from losing its core, and a classification it cannot make is not one it should print.

**The name is the observation.** `JVM Overhead` was the first candidate and was rejected for being
wrong both ways: too broad, since a preempted sampler or a suspended laptop is not the JVM, and too
narrow, since concurrent collection, JIT and barriers are JVM cost that never stops the sampler and
so is not in the number. `Paused` says what was seen; *usually GC* is a hint, and the `GC` row is
the check on it.

**The threshold is one whole step.** Below that a tick was late but none was lost. It is also the
condition the tick loop already used to resync.

**GC beans are chosen by an allow-list of names, and one unknown bean makes the count unavailable.**
`getCollectionTime()` means pause time for G1, Parallel and Serial and the length of a concurrent
cycle for the `Cycles` beans of ZGC and Shenandoah, so summing every bean would report seconds of
running time as pauses. Only G1 has been run; the other names are from memory of the JDK and have
not been checked against a live JVM.

**Spin only.** Under `PARK` or `SLEEP` the row prints *not measured*: parking is late on every tick.

**Deliberately not built, and each is an ideas.md item:** subtracting the paused time from
thread-time and time per call (38), taking it out of the duty windows so the bound stops charging
pauses to the shares (39), telling a stopped JVM from a preempted sampler without the JVM's help
(40), and saying which coarse execution a pause landed in (41). All four change numbers the report
already prints or add a dependency, and this change was held to adding a row and moving nothing.

**Not re-measured:** the bench. The hook, the slot and the walk are untouched - the diff adds one
call on the sampling thread per tick - so `--verify` and `--hook` were argued unchanged rather than
re-run. `./gradlew test` passes, 127 tests.

## Wall time = run + paused, and time on CPU over run time · 2026-10-01

The follow-up to the entry above, decided the same day after reading a real report line by line.
`Time on CPU 90.24%` and `Bound at most 10.8 pp` sat under `Paused 5.78 s`, and both were charging
the shares for the pauses: about 59.6 s of CPU over the 60.2 s anything was running is 98.9%, and
1.1 pp. A bound ten times looser than the evidence changes the verdict of the whole report, on every
workload that allocates. This is [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 39, built.

**The header, and it is Andrey's.** My version qualified the CPU line - *"98.9% while running;
90.24% of wall time with the 5.78 s paused"* - and then tried to rescue it by calling the remainder
"unpaused time". His: *"Show wall time split, wall time = run time + paused time. Show time on CPU
as it is now, but against run time."* The split defines the term once, at the top, so the CPU line
needs no qualifier and no second figure. `Run` and `Paused` are a pair.

```
Wall time     66.6 s = 60.2 s run + 6.42 s paused (9.64%)
  Paused      21 pauses, longest 2.61 s - every thread stopped, usually GC
  GC          6.43 s by the JVM's own count
...
Time on CPU   99.39% of run time
  Bound       at most 0.61 pp of any share is a thread waiting rather than working
  Verdict     the ranking is trustworthy
```

**"Wall time" keeps its ordinary meaning.** Redefining it as the non-paused part was considered and
rejected: the `Wall-time` column and the coarse spans include pauses, and one word would have meant
two things on one page.

**Only confirmed pause is subtracted.** The paused figure is the smaller of what the sampler lost
and what the JVM counted as collection, cumulatively (`PauseTracker.settle`). Each is a floor on the
time every thread was stopped, so the smaller is a floor, and subtracting a floor can leave a pause
in but cannot take running time out - the direction a bound is allowed to be wrong in. It is also
the whole defence against a preempted sampler: lateness with no collection behind it confirms
nothing. On a JVM whose collectors cannot be read, nothing is subtracted and the bound is exactly
as loose as it was.

**The split shows the confirmed figure, not the sampler's.** So the run time on the first line is
the run time the duty cycle divides by, and the page agrees with itself. What the sampler lost
beyond it is named on the `GC` row and said to be in run time.

**What moved and what did not.** The per-thread wall time that feeds `labelledDuty` has the pauses
taken out window by window, and `shareDuty`, `boundPp` and the verdict follow. `DutyReport.duty`
keeps the whole wall clock, because `machineFloor`, `offCpuSamples` and the long-execution check
read it and are about everything that happened to a thread, pauses included; the footnote under the
table still says *"the machine itself accounts for up to 10.2%"*. The `Windows` range is also left
on wall time: a window that is mostly pause has two or three CPU-clock steps left in it.

**Always printed.** `Wall time ... + 0 paused` on a quiet run, because `of run time` lower down
refers to it.

**Cost.** One read of the JVM's collection count per duty window, on the sampling thread.

**Not re-measured:** the bench, for the same reason as above. `./gradlew test` passes, 137 tests,
ten runs in a row. One earlier run failed `RegistryTest` *"the thread count is per operation and not
per run"* with 0 for 1; it did not recur and was not explained. That test starts its workers
straight after `start()` while the sampler takes its baseline on its own thread, which is a race
this change does not touch.

## Next session: the coarse output · opened 2026-09-02

Written as a handover, because the work is Andrey's to start and the context is a day old.

**Where it stands.** The fine table became `ALL OPERATIONS` and now carries a starred row per coarse
operation, on own time. The coarse table below it is unchanged from when it was built, and is the
one part of the report Andrey has never worked through - his words: *"I will look into coarse output
and 100% we will need to change it as I don't like it now."* So expect the shape to move, not just
the wording.

**What is already known to be wrong or missing there**, so the next session does not rediscover it:

- **No self time**, so `Total` is inclusive and a parent always outranks its children -
  [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 28, with the cross-thread race that makes it non-trivial. Note that the
  merged table did **not** need this: its own-time figures are sampled, and item 28 is about
  subtracting *measured spans*.
- **The lines under the table carry three different things** - a share, a parallelism sentence, and
  a "was made of" breakdown - and they were moved out of columns for a reason worth re-reading
  before moving them back: two questions (*is one execution split across threads* / *how many
  executions run at once*) were adjacent columns with nothing saying they differed.
- **An own-time figure was proposed and not built** - [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 37, including the
  trap that killed the obvious version.
- **`Workers` and `Pool` are fine-tier columns.** The coarse equivalents would be threads per
  execution, which is what the parallelism line already says in prose.

**What not to break.** The share denominator is now `fineHits + coarseSelfHits` and the two
partition; the coverage block reads `unlabelledHits`, which is `idleHits` minus the coarse self
hits. A run labelled only with coarse spans used to report zero coverage, and that is the test case
to keep re-running - the sandbox does exactly this today.

## Phase 7 — library surface · not started

What someone else has to touch to use this. The *placement essentials* were pulled forward into
phase 3.75, because the first trial could not use the documented API at all and because the coarse
tier needs the same machinery. What is left here is everything that hardens a surface rather than
making one exist.

Two ways of placing fine labels, because operations do not always coincide with method boundaries:

- **Annotations plus a bytecode agent.** `@Profiled("expand")` on a method, transformed at class
  load. No runtime dependency at the call site, attachable to a running JVM, removable by dropping
  a flag. The agent does not fight the JIT — it rewrites bytecode and C2 inlines the wrapper
  afterwards, exactly as it does for the hand-written form.
- **Explicit calls** for everything else: a loop body, half a method, a span across several calls.

Coarse operations are explicit by nature — they delimit logical work, which an annotation on a
method usually cannot express.

Also here, and not yet designed: operations registered at runtime by name rather than a fixed
array; surviving pools that create and destroy threads for the life of a process; reading results
through an API rather than `println`; and whether the profiler can be left on permanently — at
~2 ns per hook it may well be cheap enough, but that should be a decision with a measurement
behind it.

**Standing constraint:** it must not require the user to hand over thread creation. That already
ruled out an otherwise attractive optimisation — a slot field on a `Thread` subclass would be
roughly twice as fast as a `ThreadLocal` lookup — and it is not negotiable, since
`Dispatchers.Default` creates its own carrier threads and you cannot substitute them.

## Phase 8 — JFR output · not started

JFR as the transport, not as the mechanism.

**One thing to design in from the start: the event needs a tier field.** The two id spaces both
count from zero, so a fine operation and a coarse one can share the number 0. Inside the library the
types keep them apart, but an event carrying `id = 0` has left the type system and is ambiguous to
whatever reads it. Cheap to add now, and a silent misattribution in somebody else's tooling if it is
not — see [ideas.md](ideas.md) item 26 for the same problem at the Java boundary.

A custom JFR event per *operation* is hopeless — events cost tens of nanoseconds even without stack
traces, and Datadog's attempt at scope events inflated recordings more than tenfold. But one
aggregated event per second carrying the counters costs nothing and lands in a format people
already have tooling for: JMC, flight recordings, existing pipelines.
