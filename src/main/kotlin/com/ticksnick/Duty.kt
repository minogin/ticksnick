 * How much of *labelled* occupancy was CPU — the number the report's shares are bounded by.

 * A bound and not a measurement, and it has to be: a thread can be parked *inside* a label. The
 * bench's `--lock` mode puts the label outside the acquisition on purpose and 52,422 of
 * `lockedUpdate`'s 71,839 hits caught a thread that was not runnable, so "labelled therefore
 * running" is false and the cheap version of this is not available.
 *
 * What is available is an interval, and how tight it is depends on whether thread state was
 * sampled. For thread *i*, as fractions of that thread's own occupancy:
 *
 * - `f` — off the CPU altogether, from the clock. Everything below has to fit inside it.
 * - `l` — inside some label.
 * - `w` — caught not runnable, and `wl` the part of that which was also inside a label. Both
 *   measured per sample rather than inferred.
 *
 * **Without state**, all that can be said is `min(f, l)`: no more stall inside labels than there is
 * stall, and no more than there are labels. Sound, and on a thread pool useless — a pool thread
 * parks between tasks and works inside a label, so both terms are large and the bound assumes the
 * parking happened inside the label. Measured on Lucene: a true ~98% printed as 47.35%, and a
 * 100 pp error on shares that were fine.
 *
 * **With state** the visible half is not an assumption at all. `wl` *is* the waiting that was
 * inside a label. What is left over, `f − w`, is off-CPU the state read cannot see — a preempted
 * thread and a thread in a native call both read `RUNNABLE` — and that part still has to be assumed
 * worst case, all of it inside labels. So `min(l, wl + max(0, f − w))`.
 *
 * Still an upper bound, and on Lucene a tight one: 29.9 of the 31.3 points of off-CPU there were
 * observably not runnable, leaving 1.4 to assume the worst about.
 *
 * A free function over six arrays rather than a method, because everything it does is arithmetic
 * and arithmetic should be checkable without starting a sampler. The regimes it has to get right
 * are the ones the trials found, and they are in `DutyBoundTest`.
 *
 * @param slotHits every sample taken at that slot, labelled or not. Its length bounds the walk, so
 *   a caller with three threads passes arrays of three.
 * @param slotLabelled those of them that were inside some operation.
 * @param slotWaiting those that caught the thread not runnable, and [slotLabelledWaiting] the ones
 *   that were also inside a label.
