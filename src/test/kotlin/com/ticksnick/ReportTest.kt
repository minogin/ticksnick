 * The rendering tests assert **invariants, not wording**. A golden file would be the obvious thing

 * its lines were rewritten this week — and a test that fails on every rewrite teaches people to
 * regenerate it without reading. What must not change is that a below-floor label always produces a
 * warning, that a bound which found nothing never prints a number, and that a stopped session
 * cannot render as though it were a result.
